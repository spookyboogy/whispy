[0:00:00 -> 0:00:05] So it's now like at the beginning that we have to chase?
[0:00:06 -> 0:00:08] I think one adult coming up,
[0:00:08 -> 0:00:11] like if it were only you, Joe, coming up by yourself
[0:00:11 -> 0:00:14] and moving quietly around the room, I think we'd be fine.
[0:00:14 -> 0:00:15] Sure.
[0:00:15 -> 0:00:17] I mean, we could pass her.
[0:00:17 -> 0:00:19] Or ask her, you know, do you mind if I come in?
[0:00:19 -> 0:00:21] I have to take my stuff.
[0:00:21 -> 0:00:24] That was the thought process of sending an adult up here
[0:00:24 -> 0:00:27] was to just make sure that the classroom is ready
[0:00:27 -> 0:00:29] so that we don't, and so that someone has eyes on it
[0:00:29 -> 0:00:31] before we come in.
[0:00:31 -> 0:00:34] So then before we leave, we can make sure it's the same.
[0:00:34 -> 0:00:36] So like, I don't wanna.
[0:00:36 -> 0:00:38] But today, there were children.
[0:00:38 -> 0:00:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:00:39 -> 0:00:40] Which is different, yeah.
