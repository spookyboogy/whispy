[0:00:00 -> 0:00:05] So it's now like at the beginning that we have to trace it?
[0:00:06.120000 -> 0:00:09.760000] I think one adult coming up, like if you were only you,
[0:00:09.760000 -> 0:00:12.720000] Joe, coming up by yourself and moving quietly
[0:00:12.720000 -> 0:00:14.760000] around the room, I think we'd be fine.
[0:00:14.760000 -> 0:00:15.600000] Sure.
[0:00:15.600000 -> 0:00:17.140000] I mean, we could pass her.
[0:00:17.140000 -> 0:00:19.720000] Or ask her, you know, do you mind if I come in?
[0:00:19.720000 -> 0:00:21.320000] I have to take a question.
[0:00:21.320000 -> 0:00:24.200000] That was the thought process of sending an adult up here
[0:00:24.200000 -> 0:00:27.180000] was to just make sure that like the classroom is ready
[0:00:27.180000 -> 0:00:29.620000] so that we don't, and so that someone has eyes on it
[0:00:30.240000 -> 0:00:31.760000] before we come in.
[0:00:31.760000 -> 0:00:34.880000] So then before we leave, we can make sure it's the same.
[0:00:34.880000 -> 0:00:36.160000] So like I don't wanna.
[0:00:36.160000 -> 0:00:38.800000] But today, there were children.
[0:00:38.800000 -> 0:00:40.600000] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:00:40.600000 -> 0:00:44.720000] She even said that, I'm not sure what that woman was
[0:00:44.720000 -> 0:00:47.060000] at the end, I think that she felt that Israel
[0:00:47.060000 -> 0:00:48.680000] also should call them.
[0:00:48.680000 -> 0:00:52.320000] That Papa, Miss Papa, you call her?
[0:00:52.320000 -> 0:00:53.160000] Papa D.
[0:00:53.160000 -> 0:00:54.060000] Papa D.
[0:00:54.060000 -> 0:00:55.280000] Papa D.
[0:00:55.280000 -> 0:00:57.640000] She has a very long last name, Papa D.
[0:00:57.640000 -> 0:00:59.760000] Or Maria.
[0:01:00.920000 -> 0:01:02.100000] Miss Papa D.
[0:01:02.100000 -> 0:01:06.500000] That she told her that Israel had permission
[0:01:06.500000 -> 0:01:08.180000] to come up earlier.
[0:01:08.180000 -> 0:01:10.620000] But she said that she, I think she should,
[0:01:10.620000 -> 0:01:13.260000] I'm gonna talk to her because she should still go downstairs.
[0:01:13.260000 -> 0:01:14.380000] I'm gonna tell the para.
[0:01:14.380000 -> 0:01:16.380000] And I said, well, I can talk to the para.
[0:01:16.380000 -> 0:01:19.380000] I didn't want to, you know, make this a big.
[0:01:21.420000 -> 0:01:22.260000] Because we were only going here,
[0:01:22.260000 -> 0:01:25.420000] it was also Jeremy and who else was here?
[0:01:25.420000 -> 0:01:27.540000] Isabel and Israel, yeah.
[0:01:28.360000 -> 0:01:29.200000] Because we were all in the same class.
[0:01:29.200000 -> 0:01:33.400000] So, I have to go down, Papa D. told me to go downstairs.
[0:01:33.400000 -> 0:01:35.720000] So I went downstairs to go to the cafeteria
[0:01:35.720000 -> 0:01:37.520000] because she was like, Jada, make sure you go down.
[0:01:37.520000 -> 0:01:38.880000] So, okay.
[0:01:38.880000 -> 0:01:39.720000] So I go down.
[0:01:39.720000 -> 0:01:40.540000] For the program?
[0:01:40.540000 -> 0:01:42.440000] Yeah, but I guess that was when we first started.
[0:01:42.440000 -> 0:01:44.960000] She was just like, help out with whatever,
[0:01:44.960000 -> 0:01:45.800000] transition or whatever.
[0:01:45.800000 -> 0:01:47.280000] Yeah, she's always there helping us.
[0:01:47.280000 -> 0:01:48.840000] So that's why I go down.
[0:01:48.840000 -> 0:01:51.120000] Because she was like, go down.
[0:01:51.120000 -> 0:01:53.520000] So on Tuesdays, I don't dismiss my kids with my coach
[0:01:53.520000 -> 0:01:54.560000] until she does it.
[0:01:54.560000 -> 0:01:56.920000] And I just go straight to the cafeteria.
[0:01:57.100000 -> 0:01:58.020000] Yes, yes.
[0:01:58.020000 -> 0:01:58.860000] I went to make sure we.
[0:01:58.860000 -> 0:02:01.660000] Which is also a logistical thing to keep in mind.
[0:02:01.660000 -> 0:02:05.300000] Like, I feel like sometimes I'm gonna be late,
[0:02:05.300000 -> 0:02:06.960000] I'm late to the gym to get kids
[0:02:06.960000 -> 0:02:08.220000] because I'm coming from there.
[0:02:08.220000 -> 0:02:09.300000] You know, like just.
[0:02:10.340000 -> 0:02:11.740000] From the ambulance?
[0:02:11.740000 -> 0:02:14.620000] No, from that, like, because I'm coming from here.
[0:02:15.780000 -> 0:02:18.580000] So just like something in case, you know.
[0:02:18.580000 -> 0:02:21.540000] I mean, Israel sometimes goes downstairs to get food.
[0:02:21.540000 -> 0:02:23.380000] He went downstairs later.
[0:02:23.380000 -> 0:02:24.220000] Yes.
[0:02:24.220000 -> 0:02:25.060000] No, but I mean today.
[0:02:25.060000 -> 0:02:26.900000] It's a transition because.
[0:02:27.760000 -> 0:02:29.240000] They switch off.
[0:02:29.240000 -> 0:02:31.080000] The one that's with him for the program
[0:02:31.080000 -> 0:02:32.480000] is not the same one during the day.
[0:02:32.480000 -> 0:02:34.320000] Oh no, it's not the same one.
[0:02:34.320000 -> 0:02:36.120000] So I think they worked out an agreement
[0:02:36.120000 -> 0:02:39.520000] that she will wait here until she comes.
[0:02:39.520000 -> 0:02:43.080000] Because she usually brings Israel down at 3.15
[0:02:43.080000 -> 0:02:45.360000] because the door over there opens at 3.15,
[0:02:45.360000 -> 0:02:47.240000] five minutes before dismissal.
[0:02:47.240000 -> 0:02:51.360000] And so maybe if there's like,
[0:02:51.360000 -> 0:02:54.040000] if it's difficult to have them in the classroom,
[0:02:54.040000 -> 0:02:56.880000] I can ask the daytime power.
[0:02:57.720000 -> 0:03:01.420000] That she can bring him down at maybe at 3.20 or 3.18
[0:03:01.420000 -> 0:03:04.460000] into the cafeteria so that Miss K,
[0:03:04.460000 -> 0:03:08.100000] I believe the other power, can pick him up from there.
[0:03:08.100000 -> 0:03:09.900000] As opposed to waiting here.
[0:03:09.900000 -> 0:03:11.640000] We can do that as well.
[0:03:11.640000 -> 0:03:13.060000] But I think it was just, they just thought
[0:03:13.060000 -> 0:03:16.180000] that it would be much simpler to meet in the classroom.
[0:03:16.180000 -> 0:03:17.660000] Whatever works best for Miss Harper as well.
[0:03:17.660000 -> 0:03:20.580000] Yeah, it doesn't meet the needs of your co-teacher
[0:03:20.580000 -> 0:03:22.420000] and I want to make sure that, you know,
[0:03:22.420000 -> 0:03:25.500000] that we don't ruin your relationship with your co-teacher.
[0:03:25.500000 -> 0:03:27.400000] And it's not asking too much, I think.
[0:03:28.760000 -> 0:03:31.460000] I mean, yeah, it's easier to just stick around.
[0:03:32.400000 -> 0:03:34.960000] But you know, it's a negotiation always.
[0:03:34.960000 -> 0:03:36.080000] This is not a space.
[0:03:36.080000 -> 0:03:38.520000] So you know, also making sure when we come in
[0:03:38.520000 -> 0:03:40.440000] that if she's here, we say hello
[0:03:40.440000 -> 0:03:43.120000] and we kind of say, can we come in?
[0:03:43.120000 -> 0:03:45.400000] Or don't get too noisy if she's still here.
[0:03:46.480000 -> 0:03:49.040000] She lives here because then she has to go to meetings,
[0:03:49.040000 -> 0:03:52.360000] she said, on Mondays and Tuesdays.
[0:03:52.360000 -> 0:03:53.880000] Not a big deal, just, you know,
[0:03:53.900000 -> 0:03:57.140000] she was just suggesting meetings
[0:03:57.140000 -> 0:03:58.620000] and you know, asking politely,
[0:03:58.620000 -> 0:04:01.980000] would it be okay to have those five minutes after school?
[0:04:01.980000 -> 0:04:04.420000] So she comes back at 3.25.
[0:04:04.420000 -> 0:04:06.220000] Yes, and she's doing this meet-up by herself.
[0:04:06.220000 -> 0:04:08.020000] So maybe that load.
[0:04:08.020000 -> 0:04:10.980000] Sometimes later than 3.25, she has to go across the street.
[0:04:10.980000 -> 0:04:15.980000] So it could be like 3.28-ish as well, yeah.
[0:04:16.980000 -> 0:04:20.180000] Yeah, that's about the logistics.
[0:04:20.180000 -> 0:04:22.220000] Otherwise, good.
[0:04:22.680000 -> 0:04:24.800000] Children were respectful with the space.
[0:04:24.800000 -> 0:04:27.080000] And in the other class, Manuel,
[0:04:27.080000 -> 0:04:29.480000] you took a photograph of Robin's class.
[0:04:29.480000 -> 0:04:30.320000] Yeah.
[0:04:30.320000 -> 0:04:31.140000] And everything is like that.
[0:04:31.140000 -> 0:04:31.980000] Yeah, everything is already organized.
[0:04:31.980000 -> 0:04:36.160000] Yeah, we didn't know a lot of the stuff.
[0:04:36.160000 -> 0:04:37.680000] Did you check the whiteboard?
[0:04:37.680000 -> 0:04:38.520000] Yeah, I checked the whiteboard, yeah.
[0:04:38.520000 -> 0:04:39.960000] Because that's been the thing.
[0:04:39.960000 -> 0:04:42.560000] Jeremy here wanted to write on the board.
[0:04:42.560000 -> 0:04:45.480000] I think she was a whiteboard marker.
[0:04:47.120000 -> 0:04:51.680000] Jeremy, we haven't seen him since the break.
[0:04:52.620000 -> 0:04:54.380000] He's been sick a lot.
[0:04:54.380000 -> 0:04:55.220000] He's sick or something.
[0:04:55.220000 -> 0:04:57.420000] I think he was here this morning.
[0:04:57.420000 -> 0:05:00.460000] Maybe on Wednesday, yeah, but I wasn't here on Wednesday.
[0:05:00.460000 -> 0:05:02.460000] Okay, so he was here on Wednesday, great.
[0:05:03.820000 -> 0:05:05.100000] I thought I saw him the week before.
[0:05:05.100000 -> 0:05:07.300000] Yeah, and I saw him the first week too.
[0:05:07.300000 -> 0:05:08.420000] On Wednesday too.
[0:05:08.420000 -> 0:05:09.260000] Yeah.
[0:05:09.260000 -> 0:05:10.180000] Yeah, probably.
[0:05:10.180000 -> 0:05:11.620000] I hadn't seen him myself.
[0:05:11.620000 -> 0:05:14.580000] He left my station today.
[0:05:14.580000 -> 0:05:15.420000] Yeah, he came to us.
[0:05:15.420000 -> 0:05:16.240000] He came to us.
[0:05:16.240000 -> 0:05:18.220000] He's like, my musica?
[0:05:18.220000 -> 0:05:20.260000] Oh, he was looking for the movement.
[0:05:20.260000 -> 0:05:21.100000] My musica.
[0:05:21.100000 -> 0:05:21.920000] My musica.
[0:05:21.920000 -> 0:05:22.760000] I think I remember.
[0:05:22.760000 -> 0:05:25.600000] Your team seemed very different.
[0:05:25.600000 -> 0:05:27.200000] When he left.
[0:05:27.200000 -> 0:05:28.040000] My team?
[0:05:28.040000 -> 0:05:31.040000] He asked for, he wanted to go to the toilet, to get water.
[0:05:31.040000 -> 0:05:31.880000] To get water.
[0:05:31.880000 -> 0:05:32.720000] No movement.
[0:05:32.720000 -> 0:05:33.560000] So, then when he returned.
[0:05:33.560000 -> 0:05:35.400000] No movement and acting.
[0:05:35.400000 -> 0:05:37.680000] He met Patricia and he went to her.
[0:05:37.680000 -> 0:05:39.200000] He's a runner, so.
[0:05:39.200000 -> 0:05:41.800000] But that's okay, you know, we do want children
[0:05:41.800000 -> 0:05:45.200000] in this space to feel they have some agency in choosing.
[0:05:45.200000 -> 0:05:48.120000] Jeremy might be overlooking it at times.
[0:05:48.120000 -> 0:05:49.340000] I was like, oh no.
[0:05:49.340000 -> 0:05:50.180000] Yeah.
[0:05:50.180000 -> 0:05:51] Yeah.
[0:05:51 -> 0:05:51.840000] Yeah.
[0:05:51.840000 -> 0:05:52.660000] Yeah.
[0:05:52.660000 -> 0:05:55.300000] But it's interesting for us also to see
[0:05:55.300000 -> 0:05:58.220000] how children maneuver the space and ask for things
[0:05:58.220000 -> 0:06:01.540000] and try to make their interest happen.
[0:06:01.540000 -> 0:06:04.020000] But he's much more receptive to like,
[0:06:04.020000 -> 0:06:06.100000] redirection now.
[0:06:06.100000 -> 0:06:10.660000] Also because the children with him redirect like,
[0:06:10.660000 -> 0:06:11.500000] some of the behavior.
[0:06:11.500000 -> 0:06:12.320000] Jeremy?
[0:06:12.320000 -> 0:06:13.160000] Yeah.
[0:06:13.160000 -> 0:06:15.900000] He has a lot of trauma, so we think it's a trauma response.
[0:06:15.960000 -> 0:06:17.240000] When he like, shuts down.
[0:06:17.240000 -> 0:06:21.880000] Like, you know when I was saying Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
[0:06:21.880000 -> 0:06:23.960000] You say his name like, five, six times
[0:06:23.960000 -> 0:06:26.080000] and he just shuts down.
[0:06:26.080000 -> 0:06:28] We think it's because of like, trauma.
[0:06:28 -> 0:06:30.680000] So, it's something that we're working with.
[0:06:30.680000 -> 0:06:33.040000] But the children have been kind of like, bringing him in.
[0:06:33.040000 -> 0:06:34.840000] Like, the second period was kind of funny.
[0:06:34.840000 -> 0:06:36.160000] Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:06:36.160000 -> 0:06:38.080000] Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.
[0:06:38.080000 -> 0:06:38.920000] So, if it's working, then it's great.
[0:06:38.920000 -> 0:06:39.760000] For sure.
[0:06:39.760000 -> 0:06:43.200000] I think he feels like, pretty comfortable
[0:06:43.220000 -> 0:06:46.060000] and I feel like because they're second periods perhaps,
[0:06:46.060000 -> 0:06:48.900000] he also feels like, you know, hands are scratched.
[0:06:48.900000 -> 0:06:49.740000] That's it.
[0:06:49.740000 -> 0:06:50.580000] Sorry.
[0:06:50.580000 -> 0:06:54.300000] And I also feel like, usually when we go downstairs
[0:06:54.300000 -> 0:06:58.940000] to wait for him to his mom or her dad,
[0:06:58.940000 -> 0:07:01.180000] we usually wait like, 10, 15 minutes
[0:07:01.180000 -> 0:07:04.140000] and the three of us have been playing with him
[0:07:04.140000 -> 0:07:05.100000] and those kind of things.
[0:07:05.100000 -> 0:07:08.020000] So, I feel like, just connecting with him is also helpful.
[0:07:08.020000 -> 0:07:09.020000] And Dariel.
[0:07:09.020000 -> 0:07:11.700000] Yes, but Dariel usually goes faster.
[0:07:11.720000 -> 0:07:14.800000] But I feel like he's always been there to play a little.
[0:07:14.800000 -> 0:07:17.360000] And today too, their chemistry was pretty good.
[0:07:17.360000 -> 0:07:18.200000] Yeah, I know.
[0:07:18.200000 -> 0:07:19.040000] And anything he needs,
[0:07:19.040000 -> 0:07:21.440000] like, the kids will want to speak English to each other,
[0:07:21.440000 -> 0:07:22.760000] like the second graders.
[0:07:22.760000 -> 0:07:24.640000] But then I'm like, hey, he's here too.
[0:07:24.640000 -> 0:07:27.680000] Like, let's try to also just speak in Spanish in general.
[0:07:27.680000 -> 0:07:30.960000] But, so Dariel will always be that person to.
[0:07:30.960000 -> 0:07:34.040000] Yeah, well I think it also sometimes is helpful
[0:07:34.040000 -> 0:07:36.320000] to have for them a purpose,
[0:07:36.320000 -> 0:07:37.440000] like a reason why they have to be.
[0:07:37.440000 -> 0:07:39.240000] You know, like a reason for them to speak Spanish.
[0:07:39.380000 -> 0:07:41.940000] It's not just like, mean to us saying,
[0:07:41.940000 -> 0:07:43.180000] like, you need to speak Spanish.
[0:07:43.180000 -> 0:07:45.340000] But it's like, your friend.
[0:07:45.340000 -> 0:07:46.780000] We need to include your friend,
[0:07:46.780000 -> 0:07:48.980000] who's like here and wants to be part of the conversation.
[0:07:48.980000 -> 0:07:51.180000] Like, that creates a very, you know,
[0:07:52.660000 -> 0:07:53.980000] real reason versus just not.
[0:07:53.980000 -> 0:07:54.820000] Fending something.
[0:07:54.820000 -> 0:07:55.660000] Yeah.
[0:07:55.660000 -> 0:07:59.700000] So, with Jeremy, your approach is,
[0:07:59.700000 -> 0:08:02.660000] I'm just curious, like, you say his name several times
[0:08:02.660000 -> 0:08:03.820000] to get his attention?
[0:08:05.460000 -> 0:08:06.540000] Sorry, that's a lot.
[0:08:06.560000 -> 0:08:10.800000] But it's honestly, for right now,
[0:08:10.800000 -> 0:08:14.120000] what we've been doing is just trying to get his attention.
[0:08:14.120000 -> 0:08:15.400000] And then when we get his attention,
[0:08:15.400000 -> 0:08:17.240000] we say, buddy, I've been talking to you.
[0:08:17.240000 -> 0:08:18.840000] Like, did you hear me?
[0:08:18.840000 -> 0:08:21.640000] And he'll say, no, I didn't, or something.
[0:08:21.640000 -> 0:08:23.840000] So we just kind of just talk him through it.
[0:08:25.480000 -> 0:08:26.980000] And that seems to work.
[0:08:28.240000 -> 0:08:31.240000] I think he was like, also maybe a little overstimulated.
[0:08:32.580000 -> 0:08:33.900000] And so. Today?
[0:08:33.900000 -> 0:08:35.200000] Yeah, today.
[0:08:35.200000 -> 0:08:38.020000] But he usually is in a different world.
[0:08:38.020000 -> 0:08:40.820000] So it's constant redirections with him.
[0:08:40.820000 -> 0:08:43.380000] Constant checking in with him.
[0:08:43.380000 -> 0:08:45.220000] Even when the friends, which is why,
[0:08:45.220000 -> 0:08:46.380000] it's good that it's happening,
[0:08:46.380000 -> 0:08:48.580000] that the kids are talking to him.
[0:08:48.580000 -> 0:08:49.900000] But even in class, the kids will go,
[0:08:49.900000 -> 0:08:50.980000] Heddy's not listening to me.
[0:08:50.980000 -> 0:08:53.180000] I'm talking to him, and he's just not listening.
[0:08:53.180000 -> 0:08:54.020000] Yeah.
[0:08:54.020000 -> 0:08:55.380000] I don't know if he were there the whole time
[0:08:55.380000 -> 0:08:56.780000] when he was still at my station,
[0:08:56.780000 -> 0:08:58.180000] but was there anything I did
[0:08:58.180000 -> 0:08:59.740000] that you feel like might have overwhelmed him,
[0:08:59.740000 -> 0:09:00.940000] or overstimulated him?
[0:09:00.940000 -> 0:09:02.780000] No, not you, not like you.
[0:09:02.800000 -> 0:09:04] The way it was running,
[0:09:04 -> 0:09:05.840000] that could have been different for him.
[0:09:05.840000 -> 0:09:08.120000] It was just like an exciting thing.
[0:09:08.120000 -> 0:09:09.840000] I don't think it was anything that
[0:09:12.120000 -> 0:09:15.400000] was necessarily done incorrectly or anything like that.
[0:09:15.400000 -> 0:09:16.920000] I was trying to get them excited,
[0:09:16.920000 -> 0:09:18.160000] so it might have been.
[0:09:18.160000 -> 0:09:19.640000] Oh, but that's surprising, right?
[0:09:19.640000 -> 0:09:22.120000] That he would leave something that, for me,
[0:09:22.120000 -> 0:09:24.240000] seemed, I was anticipating this would be
[0:09:24.240000 -> 0:09:26.680000] the most exciting part for the children.
[0:09:26.680000 -> 0:09:29.720000] He, I don't know, it's kind of like,
[0:09:29.720000 -> 0:09:31.200000] I don't know if he dissociates,
[0:09:31.220000 -> 0:09:33.700000] or dissociates, or whatever.
[0:09:35.420000 -> 0:09:39.060000] And also maybe, I don't know, I feel like when
[0:09:41.180000 -> 0:09:45.700000] when you've already been at a heightened emotional state,
[0:09:45.700000 -> 0:09:49.500000] like even good things that bring you up
[0:09:49.500000 -> 0:09:50.660000] can be overwhelming.
[0:09:50.660000 -> 0:09:52.620000] It just gets overwhelming quickly.
[0:09:54.660000 -> 0:09:56.900000] And so maybe that, just it was like,
[0:09:56.900000 -> 0:10:00.460000] he got excited, which is generally a good emotion,
[0:10:00.520000 -> 0:10:02.600000] but just for him, became too much to handle.
[0:10:02.600000 -> 0:10:03.440000] You know, it just is what it is.
[0:10:03.440000 -> 0:10:05.480000] I do think a part of it also was like,
[0:10:05.480000 -> 0:10:07.560000] he didn't have the microphone the whole time.
[0:10:07.560000 -> 0:10:09.480000] Like I was trying to get everybody's input,
[0:10:09.480000 -> 0:10:11.560000] and I saw him kind of get frustrated.
[0:10:11.560000 -> 0:10:12.400000] That's okay.
[0:10:12.400000 -> 0:10:14.200000] It's okay, I never take it personally.
[0:10:14.200000 -> 0:10:15.440000] No, no, yeah, and I don't think
[0:10:15.440000 -> 0:10:18.240000] he should have the microphone the whole time.
[0:10:18.240000 -> 0:10:21.960000] I'm just trying to assess how to best navigate it.
[0:10:21.960000 -> 0:10:23.680000] You've had enough, too.
[0:10:23.680000 -> 0:10:26.560000] I think you did everything with all of the strategy
[0:10:26.560000 -> 0:10:27.640000] and things that he was saying,
[0:10:27.640000 -> 0:10:30.160000] I think it was justified, so.
[0:10:30.860000 -> 0:10:34.220000] He also might like to take his own,
[0:10:34.220000 -> 0:10:35.620000] you know, to make decisions.
[0:10:35.620000 -> 0:10:38.940000] It might be the one space where he can decide,
[0:10:38.940000 -> 0:10:41.980000] I'm moving more freely, or I have choices.
[0:10:41.980000 -> 0:10:44.460000] Like with Christina and I, we gave him the choice,
[0:10:44.460000 -> 0:10:47.140000] do you want to work with Miss Christina or with me?
[0:10:47.140000 -> 0:10:48.580000] And he chose Christina.
[0:10:49.740000 -> 0:10:52.380000] And you know, it's hard to hear, but.
[0:10:52.380000 -> 0:10:54.340000] But it was also like, he played it really well,
[0:10:54.340000 -> 0:10:55.860000] because you were like, oh my God, really?
[0:10:55.860000 -> 0:10:56.820000] Like you don't want to talk to me?
[0:10:56.820000 -> 0:10:59.460000] He was like, and she was like, no, it's okay, I know.
[0:10:59.480000 -> 0:11:00.760000] I know we're still friends, right?
[0:11:00.760000 -> 0:11:01.600000] And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:11:01.600000 -> 0:11:03.680000] It was a good bonding moment.
[0:11:03.680000 -> 0:11:05.720000] Yeah, yeah, it was a good bonding moment,
[0:11:05.720000 -> 0:11:08.400000] and then he was shaking hands with me.
[0:11:08.400000 -> 0:11:10.520000] It's fine, it's not that he doesn't,
[0:11:10.520000 -> 0:11:13.840000] like he's making decisions and being a person, right?
[0:11:13.840000 -> 0:11:16.280000] In that process, and trying it out
[0:11:16.280000 -> 0:11:17.960000] and seeing how this works.
[0:11:17.960000 -> 0:11:20.400000] You know, if you choose to go to another center.
[0:11:20.400000 -> 0:11:22.640000] We did have, in the past, we had some time
[0:11:22.640000 -> 0:11:24.960000] for children to choose to go to other centers.
[0:11:24.960000 -> 0:11:25.800000] Yeah.
[0:11:25.800000 -> 0:11:30.800000] So, you know, we were totally out of our space to do that.
[0:11:30.820000 -> 0:11:33.020000] Yeah, it was no problem.
[0:11:33.020000 -> 0:11:34.300000] It should have worked out.
[0:11:34.300000 -> 0:11:36.060000] So you just, I mean, right?
[0:11:36.060000 -> 0:11:37.380000] You just allowed him, that's how you.
[0:11:37.380000 -> 0:11:38.740000] Well, yeah, kind of.
[0:11:38.740000 -> 0:11:41.860000] He didn't come back, and then we heard he was there.
[0:11:43.020000 -> 0:11:46.020000] Yeah, I was like, oh, I guess he left somewhere.
[0:11:46.020000 -> 0:11:48.320000] Yeah, we knew he was accounted for somewhere.
[0:11:49.940000 -> 0:11:51.860000] Yeah, that worries me a little bit.
[0:11:51.860000 -> 0:11:53.620000] Like at one point, he left the room too,
[0:11:53.640000 -> 0:11:56.920000] which I followed him, because what worries me,
[0:11:56.920000 -> 0:11:59.920000] I mean, I don't know how often he might disappear.
[0:11:59.920000 -> 0:12:02] He does it quite often, but he did ask.
[0:12:02 -> 0:12:05.360000] He asked somebody, I forget who he asked, to get water.
[0:12:05.360000 -> 0:12:06.200000] And I had a conversation with him,
[0:12:06.200000 -> 0:12:08.800000] because he recently started sitting on the bathroom floor
[0:12:08.800000 -> 0:12:10.880000] and just zoning out.
[0:12:10.880000 -> 0:12:12.440000] And so we had a conversation,
[0:12:12.440000 -> 0:12:15.180000] make sure you go to the water, come back,
[0:12:15.180000 -> 0:12:17.240000] don't go to the bathroom, don't go to the floor,
[0:12:17.240000 -> 0:12:18.600000] just come straight back.
[0:12:18.600000 -> 0:12:19.440000] And that's when he saw you.
[0:12:19.440000 -> 0:12:22.120000] I saw him see you, and I saw him see you.
[0:12:22.140000 -> 0:12:25.220000] I saw you direct him, or not, like talk to him,
[0:12:25.220000 -> 0:12:26.060000] and you went into the other room,
[0:12:26.060000 -> 0:12:27.620000] and he was like, okay, he's fine.
[0:12:27.620000 -> 0:12:28.460000] But I didn't know what was happening.
[0:12:28.460000 -> 0:12:30.420000] Don't leave the room by yourself,
[0:12:30.420000 -> 0:12:32.900000] because we get scared, we don't know where you are.
[0:12:32.900000 -> 0:12:35.620000] Oh, he was supposed to go with somebody?
[0:12:35.620000 -> 0:12:36.940000] He was in our class.
[0:12:36.940000 -> 0:12:38.420000] He was supposed to get water.
[0:12:39.420000 -> 0:12:42.340000] He was coming from there, but he hadn't asked.
[0:12:42.340000 -> 0:12:43.180000] No, he asked.
[0:12:43.180000 -> 0:12:44.020000] He asked one of us.
[0:12:44.020000 -> 0:12:44.840000] He asked.
[0:12:44.840000 -> 0:12:45.680000] He asked us.
[0:12:45.680000 -> 0:12:46.520000] He came here?
[0:12:46.520000 -> 0:12:47.360000] He was in our group.
[0:12:47.360000 -> 0:12:49.420000] He was in my group, originally.
[0:12:49.420000 -> 0:12:51.660000] No, but this was when he was with us,
[0:12:52.200000 -> 0:12:53.040000] and then he left again.
[0:12:53.040000 -> 0:12:53.880000] Oh.
[0:12:53.880000 -> 0:12:54.700000] He left again.
[0:12:54.700000 -> 0:12:56.160000] And I don't think he has permission in that.
[0:12:56.160000 -> 0:12:57] Yeah, he doesn't.
[0:12:57 -> 0:12:59.120000] Yeah, because he was in my group, right, Christina?
[0:12:59.120000 -> 0:12:59.960000] I don't know.
[0:12:59.960000 -> 0:13:00.800000] At some point, I went out, followed him.
[0:13:00.800000 -> 0:13:02.160000] He was talking to me.
[0:13:02.160000 -> 0:13:03.520000] He was talking to me the whole time in our group,
[0:13:03.520000 -> 0:13:04.600000] so I don't think it was in our group.
[0:13:04.600000 -> 0:13:05.440000] Maybe not.
[0:13:05.440000 -> 0:13:06.280000] He doesn't leave.
[0:13:06.280000 -> 0:13:07.840000] At some point, I followed him.
[0:13:07.840000 -> 0:13:08.760000] I have talked to him.
[0:13:08.760000 -> 0:13:09.600000] He doesn't go far.
[0:13:09.600000 -> 0:13:10.720000] Maybe he could ask for permission,
[0:13:10.720000 -> 0:13:13.040000] but I followed him at some point, because he left.
[0:13:13.040000 -> 0:13:15.800000] Maybe at the beginning, because we were playing.
[0:13:15.800000 -> 0:13:17] Too recent.
[0:13:17 -> 0:13:17.840000] Maybe he walks away in the snack.
[0:13:17.840000 -> 0:13:18.680000] He walks away because he zones out,
[0:13:18.680000 -> 0:13:19.520000] and he just walks away.
[0:13:19.540000 -> 0:13:21.220000] Yeah, maybe my ideas are, you know.
[0:13:21.220000 -> 0:13:22.060000] But he doesn't go far.
[0:13:22.060000 -> 0:13:22.880000] Maybe it was in our group.
[0:13:22.880000 -> 0:13:23.720000] A lot happened.
[0:13:23.720000 -> 0:13:24.540000] He goes to the bathroom a lot.
[0:13:24.540000 -> 0:13:25.380000] I understand him.
[0:13:25.380000 -> 0:13:26.780000] I do the same.
[0:13:26.780000 -> 0:13:29.060000] Sometimes my husband is talking to me,
[0:13:29.060000 -> 0:13:30.740000] and I'm not listening.
[0:13:30.740000 -> 0:13:31.580000] This happens.
[0:13:31.580000 -> 0:13:32.420000] He always complains.
[0:13:32.420000 -> 0:13:33.240000] Yeah.
[0:13:33.240000 -> 0:13:34.080000] We have in my son's class,
[0:13:34.080000 -> 0:13:36.420000] there's a boy that also leaves the classroom
[0:13:36.420000 -> 0:13:39.460000] for the bathroom, and he disappears for two hours,
[0:13:39.460000 -> 0:13:42.100000] and the teacher gets very worried.
[0:13:42.100000 -> 0:13:42.980000] He needs a break.
[0:13:42.980000 -> 0:13:44.780000] He has also a very complicated life.
[0:13:44.780000 -> 0:13:45.620000] Yeah.
[0:13:45.620000 -> 0:13:47.620000] But you know, we need.
[0:13:47.640000 -> 0:13:49.360000] We have talked about this before,
[0:13:49.360000 -> 0:13:52.520000] that at least on my impression,
[0:13:52.520000 -> 0:13:57] is that he's still adjusting to have a routine,
[0:13:57 -> 0:14:02] and to learn the rules,
[0:14:02 -> 0:14:03.680000] and the procedures,
[0:14:03.680000 -> 0:14:06.840000] and what is supposed to be done.
[0:14:06.840000 -> 0:14:10.640000] So I think that sometimes he is on that mood.
[0:14:10.640000 -> 0:14:15.040000] Like most kids, ask permission, follow the instruction.
[0:14:15.060000 -> 0:14:16.900000] But sometimes he just.
[0:14:18.180000 -> 0:14:21.980000] I guess, I still don't know how much we can trust him.
[0:14:21.980000 -> 0:14:22.820000] This is the issue.
[0:14:22.820000 -> 0:14:26.500000] I would be happy if he goes by himself to the bathroom.
[0:14:26.500000 -> 0:14:29.060000] But I also feel a little responsible.
[0:14:30.540000 -> 0:14:33.660000] But if we think that we can trust him,
[0:14:33.660000 -> 0:14:34.500000] yeah, totally fine.
[0:14:34.500000 -> 0:14:37.460000] Especially if he had asked for permission.
[0:14:37.460000 -> 0:14:40.780000] Yeah, he's gotten better at asking.
[0:14:40.780000 -> 0:14:43.460000] Now he'll just ask to go one place,
[0:14:43.680000 -> 0:14:45.440000] and go another place too.
[0:14:45.440000 -> 0:14:47.440000] So we just kind of give him a break.
[0:14:49.360000 -> 0:14:50.960000] I mean, he can go back very quickly.
[0:14:50.960000 -> 0:14:51.800000] He will be fine.
[0:14:51.800000 -> 0:14:52.640000] It was not today.
[0:14:52.640000 -> 0:14:54.920000] He was actually very responsive,
[0:14:54.920000 -> 0:14:56.280000] he wouldn't say it, no.
[0:14:56.280000 -> 0:14:57.960000] Did you think that way, Steven?
[0:14:57.960000 -> 0:15:01.520000] Yeah, I mean, I'm just seeing progress this semester,
[0:15:01.520000 -> 0:15:03.080000] because I feel like he's more of one,
[0:15:03.080000 -> 0:15:05.280000] not running away.
[0:15:05.280000 -> 0:15:07.880000] Running is very different than walking around.
[0:15:07.880000 -> 0:15:09.080000] He also has permission today
[0:15:09.080000 -> 0:15:11.200000] to go scare the teacher next door.
[0:15:11.200000 -> 0:15:12.040000] Oh yeah, he does.
[0:15:12.060000 -> 0:15:13.940000] How many times are you scaring someone?
[0:15:13.940000 -> 0:15:16.580000] Yeah, and he asked for permission to do that.
[0:15:16.580000 -> 0:15:17.420000] You know what I mean?
[0:15:17.420000 -> 0:15:19.140000] It's like, how hilarious.
[0:15:19.140000 -> 0:15:20.940000] But can I go scare my teacher?
[0:15:22.260000 -> 0:15:24.860000] I do, I feel like I've seen progress with him.
[0:15:24.860000 -> 0:15:25.700000] Yeah.
[0:15:25.700000 -> 0:15:26.620000] Like I've seen, he's,
[0:15:27.580000 -> 0:15:28.420000] and I think you're right.
[0:15:28.420000 -> 0:15:31.500000] Like I think that, I mean, I don't know.
[0:15:31.500000 -> 0:15:33.620000] I can't, I feel like I can't be the one to be like,
[0:15:33.620000 -> 0:15:34.460000] oh, it's Trump.
[0:15:34.460000 -> 0:15:36.460000] But like, I think it seems like there's
[0:15:36.460000 -> 0:15:38.620000] just like a lot going on in that kid's head,
[0:15:38.620000 -> 0:15:41.180000] and that he doesn't know what to do with, probably.
[0:15:43.020000 -> 0:15:45.980000] But I feel like I've seen him kind of like,
[0:15:45.980000 -> 0:15:47.180000] become a little bit more stable,
[0:15:47.180000 -> 0:15:50.860000] or like a little bit more, I don't know.
[0:15:50.860000 -> 0:15:53.820000] Yeah, he's like, he doesn't fight me as much,
[0:15:53.820000 -> 0:15:55.620000] fight us as much on things, I think.
[0:15:57.780000 -> 0:15:58.860000] Which has been good.
[0:15:58.860000 -> 0:16:03.860000] When we walk down, he doesn't run away, or,
[0:16:03.900000 -> 0:16:08.060000] yeah, because the first week, he's gonna run.
[0:16:08.060000 -> 0:16:08.900000] Right.
[0:16:08.900000 -> 0:16:09.740000] Yeah.
[0:16:09.740000 -> 0:16:10.560000] We're gonna go use hands.
[0:16:10.560000 -> 0:16:13.060000] Yeah, then I was holding his hand to go down,
[0:16:13.060000 -> 0:16:14.780000] now he's just walking next to me.
[0:16:14.780000 -> 0:16:17.420000] He plays, he knows that there's gonna be a play downstairs.
[0:16:17.420000 -> 0:16:18.260000] Yes.
[0:16:18.260000 -> 0:16:19.860000] He comes here, and then he's playing around,
[0:16:19.860000 -> 0:16:23.220000] guesses the village, whatever that was, the shop,
[0:16:23.220000 -> 0:16:27.580000] and then, guess what my pizza, what food I have in my, yeah.
[0:16:27.580000 -> 0:16:28.980000] That, the pizza looks so bad.
[0:16:28.980000 -> 0:16:30.500000] He's like, should I throw it away?
[0:16:30.500000 -> 0:16:32.060000] I'm like, well, it seems cold.
[0:16:33.340000 -> 0:16:36.340000] He took another bite, and, well, just throw it away.
[0:16:36.340000 -> 0:16:39.500000] But he walks around and asks almost everybody.
[0:16:39.520000 -> 0:16:40.360000] Yeah, yeah.
[0:16:40.360000 -> 0:16:41.400000] What do you think is in my pizza?
[0:16:41.400000 -> 0:16:42.240000] Like, what is it?
[0:16:42.240000 -> 0:16:43.060000] Yeah.
[0:16:43.060000 -> 0:16:43.900000] Pizza de queso.
[0:16:43.900000 -> 0:16:44.880000] So we're connecting.
[0:16:44.880000 -> 0:16:46.200000] Yeah, Darielle came up to me,
[0:16:46.200000 -> 0:16:47.800000] and I was like, it's cheese pizza.
[0:16:47.800000 -> 0:16:48.640000] Yes, okay.
[0:16:48.640000 -> 0:16:50] I was like, okay.
[0:16:50 -> 0:16:54.640000] So let's talk about today's learning session,
[0:16:54.640000 -> 0:16:57.880000] and let's start with a star today.
[0:16:57.880000 -> 0:16:59.840000] May I, at some point, you have to tell about your,
[0:16:59.840000 -> 0:17:01.480000] the story of your tattoos.
[0:17:01.480000 -> 0:17:02.880000] Yeah, I did tell you.
[0:17:02.880000 -> 0:17:04.720000] Yeah, I was so happy.
[0:17:04.720000 -> 0:17:07.760000] I didn't mean to make that a focus of today's lesson.
[0:17:07.760000 -> 0:17:09.440000] Well, they vary, you know, because you're wearing
[0:17:10.380000 -> 0:17:11.220000] the same thing.
[0:17:11.220000 -> 0:17:12.040000] Yeah, it was too hot.
[0:17:12.040000 -> 0:17:12.880000] No, that's fine.
[0:17:12.880000 -> 0:17:13.720000] You can wear those things, right?
[0:17:13.720000 -> 0:17:15.860000] That's a very good moment.
[0:17:15.860000 -> 0:17:16.700000] Yeah.
[0:17:16.700000 -> 0:17:17.520000] It was just so funny.
[0:17:17.520000 -> 0:17:19.100000] Like, I think it's a really good thing.
[0:17:19.100000 -> 0:17:20.200000] We're all having fun.
[0:17:21.180000 -> 0:17:23.140000] They're film rolls.
[0:17:23.140000 -> 0:17:25.260000] It's medium format film.
[0:17:25.260000 -> 0:17:28.100000] So this one's a full roll, and this one's an empty roll.
[0:17:28.100000 -> 0:17:28.940000] Oh, so it's connected.
[0:17:28.940000 -> 0:17:29.780000] I do think it's connected.
[0:17:29.780000 -> 0:17:30.620000] Yeah.
[0:17:30.620000 -> 0:17:31.500000] Yeah, it is connected.
[0:17:31.500000 -> 0:17:32.860000] I guess I could have told it.
[0:17:32.860000 -> 0:17:34.700000] Yes, it's actually a good connection
[0:17:34.700000 -> 0:17:36.660000] that they realize it's so important for you,
[0:17:36.660000 -> 0:17:37.980000] and you're sharing this with them.
[0:17:37.980000 -> 0:17:40.520000] Maybe I'll bring it up in front of them.
[0:17:40.520000 -> 0:17:42.880000] I genuinely thought they were like cans or something.
[0:17:42.880000 -> 0:17:45.840000] Yeah, no, everyone thinks they're something else.
[0:17:45.840000 -> 0:17:47.160000] Campbell chicken soup or something.
[0:17:47.160000 -> 0:17:48] Campbell chicken soup.
[0:17:48 -> 0:17:49.880000] People thought, one time,
[0:17:49.880000 -> 0:17:52.300000] Oh, no, that's a new thing.
[0:17:52.300000 -> 0:17:54.920000] A cop thought I was military.
[0:17:54.920000 -> 0:17:56.760000] He thought this was one, this was a one.
[0:17:56.760000 -> 0:17:58.720000] I was like, no.
[0:17:58.720000 -> 0:18:00.240000] If anything, it looks like a two,
[0:18:00.240000 -> 0:18:01.080000] because it's both.
[0:18:01.080000 -> 0:18:02.200000] Yeah.
[0:18:02.200000 -> 0:18:03.520000] Like in Roman numerals, a two.
[0:18:03.520000 -> 0:18:05.280000] It's just very ancient.
[0:18:05.280000 -> 0:18:06.680000] Like nowadays, we don't see these.
[0:18:06.680000 -> 0:18:07.520000] Yeah, we don't see those.
[0:18:08.020000 -> 0:18:11.020000] I'm part of the first battalion of Roman legions.
[0:18:11.020000 -> 0:18:16.020000] Well, you can ask them to guess what they are.
[0:18:16.820000 -> 0:18:17.660000] Yeah.
[0:18:17.660000 -> 0:18:18.500000] And tell them.
[0:18:18.500000 -> 0:18:21.260000] What do you think, and if they're connected.
[0:18:21.260000 -> 0:18:22.100000] I could tell them.
[0:18:22.100000 -> 0:18:24.540000] Yeah, that would be a good guess and find out.
[0:18:24.540000 -> 0:18:29.180000] So, Joe, I want to hear about your group
[0:18:29.180000 -> 0:18:30.340000] and the learning that you saw.
[0:18:30.340000 -> 0:18:33.420000] Should we look at the movie first or after?
[0:18:33.420000 -> 0:18:34.700000] I'll talk about it first, and then we can.
[0:18:34.700000 -> 0:18:35.540000] Okay, okay.
[0:18:35.540000 -> 0:18:36.500000] Yeah.
[0:18:36.520000 -> 0:18:38.840000] So, I want to hear what you guys think
[0:18:38.840000 -> 0:18:41.320000] of how the up here with the whole group went.
[0:18:41.320000 -> 0:18:42.240000] I thought it went pretty well.
[0:18:42.240000 -> 0:18:45.380000] But in the small group who were there,
[0:18:46.800000 -> 0:18:48.700000] the hardest part was definitely getting them
[0:18:48.700000 -> 0:18:53.700000] to agree on different things that they were proposing.
[0:18:54.060000 -> 0:18:56.900000] But once they had, like once I was like,
[0:18:56.900000 -> 0:19:00.080000] okay, you've suggested a dog, you've suggested a cat.
[0:19:00.080000 -> 0:19:02.200000] Let's do a dog and a cat.
[0:19:02.200000 -> 0:19:05.160000] They started to be like, oh, and they could have a treat.
[0:19:05.180000 -> 0:19:06.740000] And like the cat gets a treat.
[0:19:06.740000 -> 0:19:10.740000] And then Kaylee suggested maybe they're fighting
[0:19:10.740000 -> 0:19:13.420000] over a treat and they have to share it.
[0:19:13.420000 -> 0:19:16.080000] And then someone else was like, no, no, no.
[0:19:16.080000 -> 0:19:17.880000] They each get a treat of their own.
[0:19:17.880000 -> 0:19:21.020000] And then I started to move on.
[0:19:21.020000 -> 0:19:23.320000] Like, okay, we know the stories about a dog and a cat.
[0:19:23.320000 -> 0:19:24.580000] Where is this taking place?
[0:19:24.580000 -> 0:19:26.940000] Then they were like, it's at a park.
[0:19:26.940000 -> 0:19:30.060000] And then they were like, okay, so the dog goes
[0:19:30.060000 -> 0:19:32.060000] across the slide, or down the slide.
[0:19:32.060000 -> 0:19:34.380000] And they have the monkey bars.
[0:19:34.400000 -> 0:19:35.840000] It came together as we went.
[0:19:35.840000 -> 0:19:39.400000] But Israel was upset that we didn't put a,
[0:19:39.400000 -> 0:19:42.280000] at first he was upset that we didn't put a human character
[0:19:42.280000 -> 0:19:43.920000] and he wanted a human character.
[0:19:43.920000 -> 0:19:47.280000] But then, and he was, he's the one that made the dog.
[0:19:47.280000 -> 0:19:51.560000] And he kept saying it's really ugly, stuff like that.
[0:19:51.560000 -> 0:19:52.400000] He's right.
[0:19:52.400000 -> 0:19:55.640000] Oh, that's why he wanted to draw a dog.
[0:19:55.640000 -> 0:19:57.760000] Yeah, so did you practice it with him later?
[0:19:57.760000 -> 0:19:59.360000] Oh, we talked about it.
[0:19:59.360000 -> 0:20:04.360000] So he saw me that I was drawing a dog for Kelsey.
[0:20:04.880000 -> 0:20:09.120000] And he was really mad that I was able to draw
[0:20:09.120000 -> 0:20:10.760000] with Kelsey, not with him.
[0:20:10.760000 -> 0:20:14.680000] I said, okay, let's sit down and I'll show you how I did it.
[0:20:14.680000 -> 0:20:18.680000] So we sat down and I explained that it's not that I made it,
[0:20:18.680000 -> 0:20:20.440000] I just copied it.
[0:20:20.440000 -> 0:20:24.520000] So we talk about copying things, like inspiring us.
[0:20:24.520000 -> 0:20:28] So we have the, and we did, because I did it with Kelsey,
[0:20:28 -> 0:20:30.200000] we did half and half.
[0:20:30.200000 -> 0:20:33.080000] I did the main form of the dog.
[0:20:33.140000 -> 0:20:35.100000] And then made all the little details.
[0:20:35.100000 -> 0:20:36.060000] The features.
[0:20:36.060000 -> 0:20:36.900000] Yeah.
[0:20:36.900000 -> 0:20:39.180000] Did you look up something online and copy from that?
[0:20:39.180000 -> 0:20:40.300000] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:20:40.300000 -> 0:20:45.300000] We had a picture of a dog I put there and I just did.
[0:20:45.340000 -> 0:20:47.580000] And then we did a little spelling,
[0:20:47.580000 -> 0:20:50.180000] because he wanted to write my name and his name
[0:20:50.180000 -> 0:20:51.300000] as the authors.
[0:20:52.260000 -> 0:20:53.980000] Yeah, so after we finished,
[0:20:53.980000 -> 0:20:56.900000] because I was kind of trying to rush to the next animation,
[0:20:56.900000 -> 0:20:58.140000] we didn't end up having time for it.
[0:20:58.140000 -> 0:21:01.500000] But at the end, he kept, he was trying to draw another dog
[0:21:01.880000 -> 0:21:03.520000] and was saying it's ugly.
[0:21:03.520000 -> 0:21:05.640000] And I was like, I don't think, I kept telling him,
[0:21:05.640000 -> 0:21:08.400000] we just need to practice, I don't think it's ugly.
[0:21:08.400000 -> 0:21:11.440000] Like the first dog I drew I thought was ugly too.
[0:21:11.440000 -> 0:21:13.240000] I asked him, do you want me to draw a dog?
[0:21:13.240000 -> 0:21:15.240000] And I drew one very quickly.
[0:21:15.240000 -> 0:21:16.880000] And he was like, oh, it looks great.
[0:21:16.880000 -> 0:21:20.640000] And I was like, well, the first one I drew wasn't great.
[0:21:21.720000 -> 0:21:24.320000] But that still prompted him to start drawing more.
[0:21:24.320000 -> 0:21:26.160000] Yeah, I told him the same.
[0:21:26.160000 -> 0:21:27.320000] He just kept practicing.
[0:21:27.320000 -> 0:21:29.480000] I don't know how to draw dogs.
[0:21:29.500000 -> 0:21:31.740000] I just know how to copy them.
[0:21:31.740000 -> 0:21:34.580000] Without the image, I wouldn't be able to do that.
[0:21:34.580000 -> 0:21:37.060000] After I drew my little sketch, he copied that one
[0:21:37.060000 -> 0:21:38.860000] and then he did another one of his own.
[0:21:38.860000 -> 0:21:41.060000] But I think from the beginning to the end,
[0:21:41.060000 -> 0:21:44.500000] he understood at least that he had gotten better,
[0:21:44.500000 -> 0:21:47.020000] whether or not he still thought his dogs were ugly.
[0:21:48.860000 -> 0:21:50.980000] Yeah, that's the artistic part, right?
[0:21:51.900000 -> 0:21:56.220000] Trying to imagine how a dog looks like and trying to,
[0:21:56.220000 -> 0:21:57.700000] like that's artistic process.
[0:21:57.720000 -> 0:22:01.320000] I don't want to take away, right, you're not the patient.
[0:22:01.320000 -> 0:22:04] Right, you don't want to guide them too much.
[0:22:04 -> 0:22:06.240000] But I was asking him questions like,
[0:22:06.240000 -> 0:22:07.480000] what do a dog's ears look like?
[0:22:07.480000 -> 0:22:09.680000] Are they pointy or are they flopping down?
[0:22:09.680000 -> 0:22:14.680000] And he was like, I'm thinking of something to think about.
[0:22:14.880000 -> 0:22:17.480000] But as you can see, his dog doesn't have ears.
[0:22:18.840000 -> 0:22:20.760000] We talk about the shapes.
[0:22:22.440000 -> 0:22:24.120000] Because he was worried of doing it.
[0:22:24.120000 -> 0:22:27.280000] So what I did, we talk about the shapes
[0:22:27.860000 -> 0:22:30.020000] that he could see on the drawing.
[0:22:30.020000 -> 0:22:34.780000] So now he's like, oh, okay, this is a circle.
[0:22:34.780000 -> 0:22:36.820000] Yeah, so we start with a circle.
[0:22:36.820000 -> 0:22:39.220000] And the ears look like what?
[0:22:39.220000 -> 0:22:41.300000] Say they look like hot dog bread.
[0:22:42.260000 -> 0:22:44.500000] They're completely round, they're hot dog.
[0:22:44.500000 -> 0:22:45.340000] Oh, yeah.
[0:22:45.340000 -> 0:22:46.860000] This is from the one they were looking at.
[0:22:46.860000 -> 0:22:47.700000] Yeah, the internet.
[0:22:47.700000 -> 0:22:50.060000] But I'm giving those names to the shapes.
[0:22:50.060000 -> 0:22:51.140000] Yeah, I get it.
[0:22:51.140000 -> 0:22:53.180000] Those are the shapes.
[0:22:53.180000 -> 0:22:55.180000] The survival strategy.
[0:22:55.180000 -> 0:22:57.220000] I do feel like, I get it.
[0:22:58.160000 -> 0:23:00.200000] When I was a kid, I would get so frustrated
[0:23:00.200000 -> 0:23:02.440000] when my drawings didn't look the way
[0:23:02.440000 -> 0:23:04.520000] that I thought they would in my head.
[0:23:04.520000 -> 0:23:07.480000] So just like, it's hard.
[0:23:07.480000 -> 0:23:08.320000] That's all.
[0:23:08.320000 -> 0:23:10.280000] Yeah, and so Kelsey was there.
[0:23:10.280000 -> 0:23:11.360000] She drew the cat.
[0:23:12.880000 -> 0:23:15.280000] And he was comparing, Israel was comparing
[0:23:15.280000 -> 0:23:16.800000] his dog to her cat.
[0:23:17.840000 -> 0:23:19.560000] I was saying, well, she's practiced
[0:23:19.560000 -> 0:23:20.800000] drawing a cat a lot then.
[0:23:21.760000 -> 0:23:24.480000] And she was saying that Kaylee's perfect.
[0:23:24.480000 -> 0:23:25.600000] Kaylee's perfect at everything.
[0:23:25.620000 -> 0:23:27.420000] Her teacher thinks she's perfect.
[0:23:27.420000 -> 0:23:30.020000] And Kaylee was like, no, what are you talking about?
[0:23:30.020000 -> 0:23:30.980000] I'm not perfect.
[0:23:30.980000 -> 0:23:32.220000] I was like, no one is.
[0:23:32.220000 -> 0:23:33.580000] Who said that, Israel?
[0:23:33.580000 -> 0:23:38.540000] No, Kelsey was saying that Kaylee is perfect at everything.
[0:23:38.540000 -> 0:23:41.140000] And I was like, no one's perfect at everything.
[0:23:41.140000 -> 0:23:43.340000] We had a small conversation about,
[0:23:44.460000 -> 0:23:45.500000] practicing makes you better,
[0:23:45.500000 -> 0:23:48.020000] but nobody's ever perfect at anything.
[0:23:49.620000 -> 0:23:50.580000] But you wanna watch it?
[0:23:50.580000 -> 0:23:51.420000] Yeah.
[0:23:51.420000 -> 0:23:52.240000] Yeah, I'm a big dog.
[0:23:52.240000 -> 0:23:53.340000] It's five seconds long.
[0:23:55.860000 -> 0:23:56.700000] Oh!
[0:23:57.900000 -> 0:23:59.940000] Yeah, so they also wanted to throw the treats
[0:23:59.940000 -> 0:24:02.940000] in the garbage at the end, rather than having to eat them.
[0:24:02.940000 -> 0:24:04.740000] Again, then I'll.
[0:24:04.740000 -> 0:24:05.580000] Wow.
[0:24:07.180000 -> 0:24:10.740000] So they go over the monkey bars, over the slide.
[0:24:11.660000 -> 0:24:13.780000] Aw, that's so cute.
[0:24:13.780000 -> 0:24:14.620000] Beautiful.
[0:24:14.620000 -> 0:24:16.700000] And I don't think that dog is ugly.
[0:24:16.700000 -> 0:24:17.820000] I don't think so either.
[0:24:17.820000 -> 0:24:20.220000] I think it's clear that it's a dog.
[0:24:20.220000 -> 0:24:22.020000] And it's a person's sketch, right?
[0:24:22.020000 -> 0:24:23.500000] And if he doesn't draw,
[0:24:23.520000 -> 0:24:26] just from his mind, start drawing,
[0:24:26 -> 0:24:29.440000] then he would never feel like my dog's are beautiful.
[0:24:29.440000 -> 0:24:31.840000] He was also drawing the Apple logo at one point,
[0:24:31.840000 -> 0:24:33.960000] because he had a laptop in front of him.
[0:24:33.960000 -> 0:24:34.800000] Oh, my.
[0:24:34.800000 -> 0:24:37.160000] And I was telling him, he was like,
[0:24:37.160000 -> 0:24:38.360000] it doesn't look like that one.
[0:24:38.360000 -> 0:24:40] I was like, yeah, no, but it's more interesting.
[0:24:40 -> 0:24:41.440000] I've seen that one all over.
[0:24:41.440000 -> 0:24:44.160000] I see that one everywhere, all over the world.
[0:24:44.160000 -> 0:24:47.240000] But that one, that one's different, that one's unique.
[0:24:47.240000 -> 0:24:49.320000] And he was like, yeah, but it's ugly.
[0:24:49.320000 -> 0:24:51.160000] Yeah, I told him that he,
[0:24:51.180000 -> 0:24:54.740000] like the idea of drawing was for him to practice,
[0:24:54.740000 -> 0:24:57.100000] because drawing is difficult,
[0:24:57.100000 -> 0:24:59.580000] and you need to know your forms,
[0:24:59.580000 -> 0:25:03.180000] and because we did a lot of erasing,
[0:25:03.180000 -> 0:25:06.660000] and then you have to erase and redo it,
[0:25:06.660000 -> 0:25:09.140000] and it's okay, and then you can try again,
[0:25:09.140000 -> 0:25:10.220000] again, and again.
[0:25:11.140000 -> 0:25:13.340000] The more practice, the better you get.
[0:25:13.340000 -> 0:25:14.620000] Yeah.
[0:25:14.620000 -> 0:25:18.300000] But also, sometimes ugly things are good art.
[0:25:18.300000 -> 0:25:20.020000] Are good art, yeah.
[0:25:20.020000 -> 0:25:20.860000] That's good.
[0:25:21.560000 -> 0:25:23.200000] Thousands of doughnuts for ugly.
[0:25:23.200000 -> 0:25:28.200000] You know, they are, but with abstract art,
[0:25:28.320000 -> 0:25:29.920000] sometimes at the beginning,
[0:25:29.920000 -> 0:25:34.040000] it's very relative, right, what we like or not.
[0:25:35.120000 -> 0:25:35.960000] There's a book.
[0:25:35.960000 -> 0:25:36.960000] I didn't get that.
[0:25:36.960000 -> 0:25:38.040000] Could you try again?
[0:25:38.040000 -> 0:25:38.880000] Yeah.
[0:25:38.880000 -> 0:25:40.440000] I'm not talking to you.
[0:25:40.440000 -> 0:25:43.840000] I think, I can't remember what it is in English.
[0:25:43.840000 -> 0:25:46.240000] Why do I want to say the dot?
[0:25:46.240000 -> 0:25:47.080000] Or something?
[0:25:47.080000 -> 0:25:48.400000] Peter Reynolds.
[0:25:48.400000 -> 0:25:49.240000] Peter Reynolds.
[0:25:49.240000 -> 0:25:50.080000] And ish.
[0:25:50.740000 -> 0:25:52.220000] Is it that or ish?
[0:25:52.220000 -> 0:25:53.140000] Both books, but ish.
[0:25:53.140000 -> 0:25:54.860000] Okay, okay.
[0:25:54.860000 -> 0:25:58.740000] I think it's ish in the main character
[0:25:58.740000 -> 0:26:01.100000] is making a drawing, and they crumble it up,
[0:26:01.100000 -> 0:26:03.260000] and throw it to the floor, and do it again,
[0:26:03.260000 -> 0:26:04.780000] throw it to the floor, and do it again,
[0:26:04.780000 -> 0:26:05.620000] throw it to the floor.
[0:26:05.620000 -> 0:26:07.500000] It's about perspirance and not giving up.
[0:26:07.500000 -> 0:26:10.100000] So maybe if you guys want to have her read that.
[0:26:10.100000 -> 0:26:11.300000] Well, not you guys, but like.
[0:26:11.300000 -> 0:26:12.140000] Yeah.
[0:26:12.140000 -> 0:26:14.180000] If you want to read it.
[0:26:14.180000 -> 0:26:15.300000] It's a reading tweet.
[0:26:15.300000 -> 0:26:16.140000] The whole, like.
[0:26:16.140000 -> 0:26:17.500000] And the students, yeah.
[0:26:17.520000 -> 0:26:20.480000] And it's like, it's called ish because the kid is like,
[0:26:20.480000 -> 0:26:24.040000] well, it looks like a dog ish.
[0:26:24.040000 -> 0:26:24.880000] Oh, I like that.
[0:26:24.880000 -> 0:26:26.200000] And it looks like a ish.
[0:26:26.200000 -> 0:26:27.920000] They have it in Spanish, casi.
[0:26:27.920000 -> 0:26:29] We read it in Spanish.
[0:26:29 -> 0:26:29.840000] We read casi.
[0:26:29.840000 -> 0:26:30.660000] Oh my gosh.
[0:26:30.660000 -> 0:26:31.500000] Is it from the show?
[0:26:31.500000 -> 0:26:32.340000] The character name?
[0:26:32.340000 -> 0:26:34.400000] I don't know what the character's name was.
[0:26:34.400000 -> 0:26:35.480000] I can't remember.
[0:26:35.480000 -> 0:26:36.320000] Yeah.
[0:26:36.320000 -> 0:26:37.160000] Casi un perro.
[0:26:38.120000 -> 0:26:40.120000] If we want to use that for the.
[0:26:40.120000 -> 0:26:43.320000] But it is really getting into that with art.
[0:26:43.320000 -> 0:26:45.760000] You just, at the beginning, you just don't enjoy it
[0:26:45.780000 -> 0:26:47.540000] because you feel so bad at it.
[0:26:47.540000 -> 0:26:50.040000] And you're always like judging your own
[0:26:50.040000 -> 0:26:52.580000] versus somebody else that is much better.
[0:26:52.580000 -> 0:26:55.540000] But like my daughter started drawing and painting
[0:26:55.540000 -> 0:26:56.940000] when she, during the pandemic,
[0:26:56.940000 -> 0:26:58.140000] she had never done it before.
[0:26:58.140000 -> 0:27:00.460000] And yeah, in the beginning, she felt very uncomfortable.
[0:27:00.460000 -> 0:27:02.340000] But she ended up creating a portfolio
[0:27:02.340000 -> 0:27:04.020000] two years later for LaGuardia.
[0:27:04.020000 -> 0:27:07.540000] She got in to find arts because of her art.
[0:27:08.380000 -> 0:27:09.820000] And she never felt very comfortable.
[0:27:09.820000 -> 0:27:11.940000] And she started spending hours.
[0:27:11.940000 -> 0:27:13.060000] And Peter Rangel.
[0:27:13.080000 -> 0:27:17.680000] So if we can get them to just enjoy giving that process.
[0:27:17.680000 -> 0:27:19.440000] I mean, I think that's a beautiful dog.
[0:27:19.440000 -> 0:27:20.440000] It's so unique.
[0:27:20.440000 -> 0:27:22.440000] Yeah, I think just like continuing to reinforce
[0:27:22.440000 -> 0:27:24.880000] the message of keep practicing.
[0:27:26.600000 -> 0:27:29.880000] And also that message of ugly things aren't bad art.
[0:27:29.880000 -> 0:27:30.920000] They're just different.
[0:27:30.920000 -> 0:27:33.200000] And sometimes people like that more.
[0:27:34.880000 -> 0:27:38.520000] It looks like an original Israel piece.
[0:27:38.520000 -> 0:27:41.040000] It's not like anything anyone else would draw.
[0:27:41.820000 -> 0:27:44.180000] And like seeing the value in that.
[0:27:44.180000 -> 0:27:47.580000] As long as we all have that same like messaging, I think.
[0:27:47.580000 -> 0:27:49.100000] Because they're not gonna just stop being like,
[0:27:49.100000 -> 0:27:49.940000] it's ugly.
[0:27:51.380000 -> 0:27:53.780000] That goes throughout high school.
[0:27:55.100000 -> 0:27:56.820000] But I feel like he needs,
[0:27:56.820000 -> 0:28:01.820000] I was just thinking last week when we were in meeting,
[0:28:01.940000 -> 0:28:04.100000] that he said something like,
[0:28:04.100000 -> 0:28:07.680000] para hacer esto se necesita mucha paciencia.
[0:28:07.680000 -> 0:28:08.520000] Me encanta.
[0:28:08.520000 -> 0:28:11.920000] And like, yo no tengo paciencia.
[0:28:11.920000 -> 0:28:14.360000] And then you keep talking to him,
[0:28:14.360000 -> 0:28:16.320000] then he's like, oh, okay.
[0:28:16.320000 -> 0:28:19.160000] And I was telling him, do you remember when we did,
[0:28:19.160000 -> 0:28:21.200000] with Manuel, like the process of something?
[0:28:21.200000 -> 0:28:26.200000] And I remember he drew a lime tree or something like that.
[0:28:27.800000 -> 0:28:32.320000] And I told him, you have like a lot of patience doing that.
[0:28:32.780000 -> 0:28:33.620000] And he was great.
[0:28:33.620000 -> 0:28:35.740000] And he was like, oh, yeah.
[0:28:35.740000 -> 0:28:37.460000] And then he was like, okay.
[0:28:37.460000 -> 0:28:38.660000] And then he kept knitting.
[0:28:38.660000 -> 0:28:41.460000] And after a little bit, he said like,
[0:28:41.460000 -> 0:28:43.620000] tengo que tener paciencia.
[0:28:43.620000 -> 0:28:45.220000] Me encanta.
[0:28:45.220000 -> 0:28:46.060000] It works.
[0:28:46.060000 -> 0:28:49.340000] Yeah, so I feel like he needs that push at the beginning.
[0:28:49.340000 -> 0:28:50.620000] And then.
[0:28:50.620000 -> 0:28:52.140000] Especially with these children,
[0:28:52.140000 -> 0:28:54.260000] I don't know why it just works so wonderfully
[0:28:54.260000 -> 0:28:56.140000] to remind them, well, this is learning.
[0:28:56.140000 -> 0:28:57.340000] This is important for us.
[0:28:57.340000 -> 0:28:58.620000] You want to be learning.
[0:28:58.620000 -> 0:29:00.820000] You want to ask for more opportunities to learn.
[0:29:00.840000 -> 0:29:03] Or why are we, what is bilingual?
[0:29:03 -> 0:29:05.200000] Being bilingual, you ask that question today.
[0:29:05.200000 -> 0:29:07.640000] It's an important question to remind them.
[0:29:07.640000 -> 0:29:09.840000] It's not that they don't know, but to remind them.
[0:29:09.840000 -> 0:29:11.160000] Did the connection make any sense?
[0:29:11.160000 -> 0:29:12.360000] The connection I was trying to make
[0:29:12.360000 -> 0:29:15] between like different languages of storytelling
[0:29:15 -> 0:29:18.880000] and being bilingual in general.
[0:29:18.880000 -> 0:29:21] I don't know if that, I spent enough time on that.
[0:29:21 -> 0:29:23.280000] But I was trying to connect.
[0:29:23.280000 -> 0:29:25.240000] Different ways of narrating.
[0:29:25.240000 -> 0:29:26.080000] Yeah.
[0:29:27.360000 -> 0:29:28.760000] I might have used the wrong.
[0:29:29.740000 -> 0:29:31.940000] I feel like I got it.
[0:29:31.940000 -> 0:29:32.780000] Like as an adult.
[0:29:32.780000 -> 0:29:35.860000] But I don't know, maybe some kids probably did.
[0:29:35.860000 -> 0:29:36.700000] Yeah.
[0:29:36.700000 -> 0:29:37.540000] Some maybe not.
[0:29:37.540000 -> 0:29:38.980000] As long as it made sense.
[0:29:38.980000 -> 0:29:39.820000] No, it did.
[0:29:39.820000 -> 0:29:41.660000] It was that because they're bilingual,
[0:29:41.660000 -> 0:29:44.180000] they don't have two ways of narrating.
[0:29:44.180000 -> 0:29:47.340000] Yeah, I was thinking like storytelling in the way.
[0:29:47.340000 -> 0:29:48.180000] The phone.
[0:29:48.180000 -> 0:29:49] Yeah, the way that they gave.
[0:29:49 -> 0:29:49.840000] Images of otakon.
[0:29:49.840000 -> 0:29:51.260000] Yeah, different.
[0:29:51.260000 -> 0:29:53.420000] That's one language of storytelling.
[0:29:53.420000 -> 0:29:55.820000] Whereas animation is another language of storytelling.
[0:29:55.840000 -> 0:29:59.040000] Yeah, you said there are multiple languages.
[0:29:59.040000 -> 0:30:01.040000] And we can get you this.
[0:30:01.040000 -> 0:30:01.880000] I don't know.
[0:30:01.880000 -> 0:30:02.720000] I don't know.
[0:30:02.720000 -> 0:30:04.320000] I didn't make the connection immediately.
[0:30:04.320000 -> 0:30:06.360000] But now that you're backing up.
[0:30:06.360000 -> 0:30:07.840000] Hopefully that'll happen.
[0:30:07.840000 -> 0:30:09.800000] I was focusing on what are the different things
[0:30:09.800000 -> 0:30:11.120000] I'm trying to write it down.
[0:30:11.120000 -> 0:30:12.720000] It's not that important.
[0:30:12.720000 -> 0:30:16.360000] So what's the learning that you saw in your group today?
[0:30:16.360000 -> 0:30:20.720000] I'd say the big part was Israel.
[0:30:21.800000 -> 0:30:25.560000] Seeing that growth in him of coming from like,
[0:30:26.260000 -> 0:30:27.740000] it's ugly and I give up to,
[0:30:27.740000 -> 0:30:30.180000] it's ugly but it's better than the last one.
[0:30:30.180000 -> 0:30:31.020000] He didn't say that,
[0:30:31.020000 -> 0:30:34.220000] but it seemed to be more of his attitude at the end.
[0:30:34.220000 -> 0:30:39.220000] And I think doing the,
[0:30:39.540000 -> 0:30:40.980000] they learned a lot of patience,
[0:30:40.980000 -> 0:30:42.820000] or at least became more patient
[0:30:42.820000 -> 0:30:45.540000] as they went along with on the floor there.
[0:30:45.540000 -> 0:30:46.700000] Because at first they were like,
[0:30:46.700000 -> 0:30:48.300000] okay, we want to move it over there.
[0:30:48.300000 -> 0:30:49.740000] And I'm like, no, if you do it fast,
[0:30:49.740000 -> 0:30:52.140000] it's not gonna, the animation isn't gonna work.
[0:30:52.140000 -> 0:30:55.420000] So I had to do a few photos for them.
[0:30:56.400000 -> 0:30:58.640000] I see because to move it to this side,
[0:30:58.640000 -> 0:31:00.600000] you have to take all these pictures.
[0:31:00.600000 -> 0:31:01.880000] Okay, it's there.
[0:31:01.880000 -> 0:31:04.640000] Yeah, but it's the, yeah, they understood.
[0:31:04.640000 -> 0:31:07.800000] The delaying the rework,
[0:31:07.800000 -> 0:31:10.040000] which is so important for academic learning.
[0:31:10.040000 -> 0:31:10.880000] Yeah.
[0:31:10.880000 -> 0:31:12.120000] How's that?
[0:31:12.120000 -> 0:31:14.760000] Yeah, and then they even understood at the end
[0:31:14.760000 -> 0:31:18.960000] that like, in order to make them get to the trash can fast,
[0:31:18.960000 -> 0:31:22.920000] they don't just jump over there, but they do go faster.
[0:31:22.920000 -> 0:31:25.160000] They're not like doing the same speed
[0:31:25.900000 -> 0:31:27.580000] they were doing the first time.
[0:31:27.580000 -> 0:31:29.300000] Oh, because they're sliding down?
[0:31:30.660000 -> 0:31:33.300000] Just like when they jumped up onto the slide,
[0:31:33.300000 -> 0:31:34.820000] or like different moments, they were like,
[0:31:34.820000 -> 0:31:37.060000] yeah, they're jumping, so they go faster.
[0:31:38.380000 -> 0:31:39.220000] And they had that idea.
[0:31:39.220000 -> 0:31:41.260000] They had logic to it, but yeah.
[0:31:44.300000 -> 0:31:46.460000] Maybe we can show them tomorrow,
[0:31:46.460000 -> 0:31:48.900000] that was the beginning, so they can see what.
[0:31:48.900000 -> 0:31:49.740000] We can show them.
[0:31:49.740000 -> 0:31:52.020000] Yeah, what they did.
[0:31:52.020000 -> 0:31:52.860000] This is great.
[0:31:52.860000 -> 0:31:54.220000] This is two groups.
[0:31:54.240000 -> 0:31:55.080000] One group.
[0:31:55.080000 -> 0:31:55.920000] This is one group.
[0:31:55.920000 -> 0:31:59.080000] One group, one group, you have one group, yes.
[0:31:59.080000 -> 0:32:02.800000] Why did you not have human beings,
[0:32:02.800000 -> 0:32:05.200000] people that Israel wanted?
[0:32:05.200000 -> 0:32:06.680000] I didn't say that we couldn't.
[0:32:06.680000 -> 0:32:11.680000] I just said that we have an idea here of a dog and a cat.
[0:32:11.760000 -> 0:32:13.360000] Let's start with that, and like,
[0:32:13.360000 -> 0:32:15.920000] let's start to think about the story.
[0:32:15.920000 -> 0:32:18.600000] And I kept saying, like, I said several times,
[0:32:18.600000 -> 0:32:20.520000] like, we can't put a person in.
[0:32:20.520000 -> 0:32:23.280000] But you decided to have to just draw a dog if you had to.
[0:32:23.300000 -> 0:32:27.780000] Yeah, he made the dog, so he got distracted by other things.
[0:32:27.780000 -> 0:32:28.980000] And then he made the trash can.
[0:32:28.980000 -> 0:32:30.980000] So you were accepting of the idea.
[0:32:30.980000 -> 0:32:32.900000] Yeah, I wasn't saying we can't have the person,
[0:32:32.900000 -> 0:32:34.700000] but other students were saying, like,
[0:32:34.700000 -> 0:32:36.180000] no, just the dog and a cat.
[0:32:36.180000 -> 0:32:38.180000] Or they felt that they didn't want to be a person.
[0:32:38.180000 -> 0:32:40.300000] Well, they wanted it to be either just a cat
[0:32:40.300000 -> 0:32:41.140000] or just a dog, and I was like,
[0:32:41.140000 -> 0:32:43.900000] it makes sense to have a story about a cat and a dog.
[0:32:43.900000 -> 0:32:45.300000] I don't know, I was just trying to get them
[0:32:45.300000 -> 0:32:49.100000] to get the ball rolling on storytelling.
[0:32:49.100000 -> 0:32:51.420000] No, I'm thinking about representation,
[0:32:51.440000 -> 0:32:55.520000] making sure that everybody's ideas are there
[0:32:55.520000 -> 0:32:58.240000] and recognized and valued equally, right?
[0:32:58.240000 -> 0:32:59.920000] So thinking about how that process was,
[0:32:59.920000 -> 0:33:02.600000] how they decided on the cat and the dog.
[0:33:02.600000 -> 0:33:04.120000] Because sometimes it's, you know,
[0:33:04.120000 -> 0:33:05.520000] I've had children that said,
[0:33:05.520000 -> 0:33:08.480000] I don't want to draw human beings.
[0:33:08.480000 -> 0:33:09.960000] I'm not good at drawing humans.
[0:33:09.960000 -> 0:33:12.880000] They want to draw, I don't know, a dog.
[0:33:12.880000 -> 0:33:14.120000] I don't know.
[0:33:14.120000 -> 0:33:16.360000] In this case, it doesn't seem it was connected.
[0:33:16.360000 -> 0:33:19.040000] No, yeah, I left it open.
[0:33:19.060000 -> 0:33:24.060000] We can add a human to the story, but I wanted an action.
[0:33:24.380000 -> 0:33:27.340000] Any other, in six minutes, any other learning?
[0:33:27.340000 -> 0:33:30.620000] Hannah, would you like to share your insights with us?
[0:33:30.620000 -> 0:33:32.900000] I know you were trying to grade, but.
[0:33:32.900000 -> 0:33:33.740000] Yeah, right.
[0:33:33.740000 -> 0:33:36.780000] Historically, the grades keep disappearing.
[0:33:36.780000 -> 0:33:39.140000] Yeah, I have a couple of thoughts.
[0:33:39.140000 -> 0:33:43.060000] One about, I really, really like
[0:33:43.060000 -> 0:33:48.060000] these sort of longer term projects too for them
[0:33:48.080000 -> 0:33:53.080000] and maybe having some sort of gallery walk
[0:33:53.200000 -> 0:33:57.680000] or something at the end of the week where they can,
[0:33:57.680000 -> 0:33:58.520000] I don't know.
[0:33:58.520000 -> 0:34:01.880000] Which reminds me that we could do something like this.
[0:34:01.880000 -> 0:34:03] Sorry for interrupting.
[0:34:03 -> 0:34:04] Yeah.
[0:34:04 -> 0:34:06.400000] We have, have you seen this?
[0:34:06.400000 -> 0:34:09.080000] The In Queen Project Gallery for Students,
[0:34:09.080000 -> 0:34:12] integrated project, and this is a system
[0:34:12 -> 0:34:14.160000] that we could create with the little movies.
[0:34:14.160000 -> 0:34:16.120000] It says these are about bilingual children
[0:34:16.120000 -> 0:34:17.120000] and pre-service teachers,
[0:34:17.140000 -> 0:34:19.940000] and you can look at the different presentation.
[0:34:19.940000 -> 0:34:22.860000] And you can go into different virtual rooms.
[0:34:22.860000 -> 0:34:26.060000] Like, okay, I got, sorry, I'm in the wrong,
[0:34:26.060000 -> 0:34:27.300000] let me go up.
[0:34:27.300000 -> 0:34:29.860000] Here's a door, I go to another room,
[0:34:29.860000 -> 0:34:32.220000] and here are more designed about bilingual identity
[0:34:32.220000 -> 0:34:34.340000] development in language and literacy practices,
[0:34:34.340000 -> 0:34:37.060000] and I can move around, I can look at the presentation,
[0:34:37.060000 -> 0:34:38.380000] I can give them feedback.
[0:34:38.380000 -> 0:34:40.060000] That could be a fun thing to do on the board,
[0:34:40.060000 -> 0:34:43.900000] but I think if we have them do it all on their computers,
[0:34:43.900000 -> 0:34:44.740000] it might be chaotic.
[0:34:44.740000 -> 0:34:45.700000] I kind of suggested, but yes,
[0:34:45.720000 -> 0:34:46.560000] inviting the parents.
[0:34:46.560000 -> 0:34:48.720000] Also, like, a more, a more non-tangible.
[0:34:48.720000 -> 0:34:51.080000] So, like, just maybe having something, like,
[0:34:51.080000 -> 0:34:53.080000] at the end of every week, like,
[0:34:53.080000 -> 0:34:56.560000] just like five or 10 minutes at the end of the session
[0:34:56.560000 -> 0:34:59.400000] every week so they can celebrate their work
[0:34:59.400000 -> 0:35:00.840000] and see everything that they've done
[0:35:00.840000 -> 0:35:02.840000] over the course of the time,
[0:35:02.840000 -> 0:35:05.480000] especially if there's like a longer term project.
[0:35:06.640000 -> 0:35:08.120000] Because I feel like, yeah, they're at the age
[0:35:08.120000 -> 0:35:10.240000] where it's like, they're super, super proud
[0:35:10.240000 -> 0:35:13.080000] of something they work on over.
[0:35:13.080000 -> 0:35:13.920000] Yeah.
[0:35:13.920000 -> 0:35:15.160000] And we haven't been doing that.
[0:35:15.660000 -> 0:35:17.220000] So, like, it's a longer time, like two weeks or whatever,
[0:35:17.220000 -> 0:35:20.140000] and they make a big product at the end.
[0:35:21.420000 -> 0:35:25.660000] And the other thing is similar to somebody
[0:35:25.660000 -> 0:35:27.540000] was adding on to it, like,
[0:35:27.540000 -> 0:35:30.220000] a way to share more with the families.
[0:35:30.220000 -> 0:35:33.780000] I don't know, like, making a drive or something
[0:35:33.780000 -> 0:35:36.980000] that they can check and see the work
[0:35:36.980000 -> 0:35:38.620000] that the students are doing, like,
[0:35:38.620000 -> 0:35:43.620000] uploading pictures and, like, sending things home a lot.
[0:35:43.640000 -> 0:35:45.440000] Like, I know you guys already have some days
[0:35:45.440000 -> 0:35:47.720000] where they can come in, but just, like,
[0:35:47.720000 -> 0:35:51.840000] having a place where they can also look
[0:35:51.840000 -> 0:35:56.100000] and check on what the kids are doing, I think,
[0:35:58.200000 -> 0:35:59.560000] like, when we do stuff like that,
[0:35:59.560000 -> 0:36:01.840000] the parents really appreciate it.
[0:36:01.840000 -> 0:36:04.520000] So they have access to, like, Google Drive?
[0:36:04.520000 -> 0:36:08] Yeah, like, if you just send, like, a note or whatever
[0:36:08 -> 0:36:09.520000] with a code or something.
[0:36:09.520000 -> 0:36:12.160000] Yeah, we haven't been doing, in past years,
[0:36:12.160000 -> 0:36:13.940000] we have done that in other afterschools,
[0:36:13.940000 -> 0:36:16.140000] sending a flyer home once a month
[0:36:16.140000 -> 0:36:19.460000] or with photographs of the activities and the news.
[0:36:19.460000 -> 0:36:20.660000] Yeah, exactly.
[0:36:20.660000 -> 0:36:23.500000] Just some form of that, like, either a drive
[0:36:23.500000 -> 0:36:27.700000] or, like, a collage or something like that,
[0:36:27.700000 -> 0:36:28.540000] I think is really good.
[0:36:28.540000 -> 0:36:30.500000] And we have to think about bringing the parents
[0:36:30.500000 -> 0:36:33.420000] because it's been, they came once, really,
[0:36:33.420000 -> 0:36:35.460000] because then things got interrupted.
[0:36:35.460000 -> 0:36:38.020000] So, yeah, we think about that connection with the parents
[0:36:38.020000 -> 0:36:39.180000] and miss them, too.
[0:36:39.180000 -> 0:36:41.300000] Yeah, especially stuff like this is, like,
[0:36:41.320000 -> 0:36:43.320000] really nice and the kids will be so excited
[0:36:43.320000 -> 0:36:44.900000] to show their parents.
[0:36:46 -> 0:36:47.680000] Yeah, this is what, I feel like, makes a lot of sense
[0:36:47.680000 -> 0:36:50.160000] to have this really be something that we can,
[0:36:50.160000 -> 0:36:51.880000] like, we provide them that.
[0:36:51.880000 -> 0:36:53.200000] Thank you for the reminder.
[0:36:53.200000 -> 0:36:57.720000] We're kind of forgetting half of where learning happens.
[0:36:57.720000 -> 0:37:00.160000] I know it's present, and it just hasn't happened
[0:37:00.160000 -> 0:37:02.120000] for different reasons, but we'll go back to it.
[0:37:02.120000 -> 0:37:02.960000] Yeah.
[0:37:05.760000 -> 0:37:10.760000] Any other insights, or are we adding music, sound,
[0:37:11.320000 -> 0:37:13.920000] are we writing about this, what do you think?
[0:37:13.920000 -> 0:37:16.760000] Can we take use out of this more?
[0:37:16.760000 -> 0:37:19.080000] We can do a music session, yeah,
[0:37:19.080000 -> 0:37:22.280000] with some sort of music workshop next to AXTA.
[0:37:22.280000 -> 0:37:24.840000] Oh, yeah, Dylan asked me if they can add music
[0:37:24.840000 -> 0:37:25.680000] to their video.
[0:37:25.680000 -> 0:37:27.160000] Awesome, yeah, I'm in.
[0:37:27.160000 -> 0:37:28] Because he wanted to add.
[0:37:28 -> 0:37:29.560000] I didn't get that last time, but yeah.
[0:37:29.560000 -> 0:37:31.800000] He wanted to add, I believe.
[0:37:31.800000 -> 0:37:32.640000] Mm.
[0:37:32.640000 -> 0:37:33.880000] Okay.
[0:37:33.880000 -> 0:37:34.720000] And words?
[0:37:36.840000 -> 0:37:40.120000] I mean, is Christina Stone after?
[0:37:40.120000 -> 0:37:40.960000] We can talk.
[0:37:41.900000 -> 0:37:44.140000] I don't know if you have any ideas
[0:37:44.140000 -> 0:37:46.340000] about what that might look like, or how we might do that,
[0:37:46.340000 -> 0:37:47.500000] but we can talk about it.
[0:37:47.500000 -> 0:37:48.980000] You haven't done that.
[0:37:48.980000 -> 0:37:51.580000] I mean, it could be as simple as, like,
[0:37:51.580000 -> 0:37:53.820000] pick a song that you know, and then I could go
[0:37:53.820000 -> 0:37:56.740000] and put it underneath the video.
[0:37:56.740000 -> 0:37:58.420000] Or, like, if Donna writes something,
[0:37:58.420000 -> 0:38:00.620000] it could be like two characters in a conversation,
[0:38:00.620000 -> 0:38:02.060000] they kind of like speech bubbles,
[0:38:02.060000 -> 0:38:03.700000] and just put the speech bubble for a few pictures,
[0:38:03.700000 -> 0:38:05.020000] and take it away and change it.
[0:38:05.020000 -> 0:38:05.900000] Physically.
[0:38:05.900000 -> 0:38:07.780000] Yeah, and if it's something like that, yeah.
[0:38:07.780000 -> 0:38:09.420000] Do a speech bubble and write it.
[0:38:11.780000 -> 0:38:13.780000] Or they could record it.
[0:38:16.340000 -> 0:38:18.340000] Yeah, we could also record audio for it.
[0:38:18.340000 -> 0:38:20.860000] They could record audio, and also have the speech bubbles.
[0:38:20.860000 -> 0:38:22.700000] We have the oral language, the written language,
[0:38:22.700000 -> 0:38:23.780000] the visual.
[0:38:23.780000 -> 0:38:27.340000] Most of them are also like programs on computers that you can.
[0:38:27.340000 -> 0:38:28.180000] For music making.
[0:38:28.180000 -> 0:38:30.180000] Yeah, like simple.
[0:38:30.180000 -> 0:38:31.580000] There are, yeah.
[0:38:31.580000 -> 0:38:32.780000] I don't know a lot about it.
[0:38:32.780000 -> 0:38:33.980000] We can look into it.
[0:38:33.980000 -> 0:38:37.380000] I mean, a PowerPoint would allow you to record audio.
[0:38:37.380000 -> 0:38:39.060000] Yeah, but there are some, like,
[0:38:39.080000 -> 0:38:41.680000] some tools that you can use to make simple beats.
[0:38:41.680000 -> 0:38:42.520000] And like, you know.
[0:38:42.520000 -> 0:38:43.360000] A little melody.
[0:38:43.360000 -> 0:38:45.440000] Yeah, almost like a mini,
[0:38:45.440000 -> 0:38:47.480000] there's like different programs on computers.
[0:38:47.480000 -> 0:38:49.600000] Yeah, I mean, if it's short, there are lots of free ones,
[0:38:49.600000 -> 0:38:52.320000] but then if they're longer, then they have the.
[0:38:52.320000 -> 0:38:53.160000] The paywall.
[0:38:53.160000 -> 0:38:53.980000] Yeah.
[0:38:53.980000 -> 0:38:54.960000] Well, these are five seconds long.
[0:38:54.960000 -> 0:38:55.800000] Yeah.
[0:38:55.800000 -> 0:38:56.640000] Yeah.
[0:38:56.640000 -> 0:38:58.920000] But there's a lot of beauty in that.
[0:38:58.920000 -> 0:39:01.160000] And there's a sequence, and you know,
[0:39:01.160000 -> 0:39:05.080000] it's just another, it's another text, it's a visual text.
[0:39:05.080000 -> 0:39:08.360000] So, you keep saying, you know, it's only five seconds,
[0:39:08.380000 -> 0:39:10.420000] but we are very impressed, right?
[0:39:10.420000 -> 0:39:11.260000] Oh, yeah.
[0:39:11.260000 -> 0:39:12.080000] I know, I mean.
[0:39:12.080000 -> 0:39:12.920000] It's a super movie.
[0:39:12.920000 -> 0:39:13.760000] You're gonna be so.
[0:39:13.760000 -> 0:39:15.620000] There's a lot in just the five seconds.
[0:39:15.620000 -> 0:39:17.220000] Yeah, there you go.
[0:39:17.220000 -> 0:39:19.100000] And because, you know, it's just the beginning.
[0:39:19.100000 -> 0:39:21.540000] I think that the children will generate new ideas
[0:39:21.540000 -> 0:39:22.580000] from this work.
[0:39:23.780000 -> 0:39:24.720000] Seeing these ones.
[0:39:26.420000 -> 0:39:27.620000] This was fun.
[0:39:27.620000 -> 0:39:28.460000] It was fun.
[0:39:28.460000 -> 0:39:29.280000] It was a lot.
[0:39:29.280000 -> 0:39:30.120000] Yeah.
[0:39:30.120000 -> 0:39:33.460000] Yeah, the last time I ran this, it was like a workshop
[0:39:33.460000 -> 0:39:35.380000] on like a Steam event day,
[0:39:35.400000 -> 0:39:39.120000] and I had different groups of like five fourth
[0:39:39.120000 -> 0:39:41.240000] and fifth graders coming every 15 minutes.
[0:39:41.240000 -> 0:39:44.280000] So like, I would finish with one, another would come.
[0:39:44.280000 -> 0:39:46.880000] So running one today and one tomorrow feels
[0:39:46.880000 -> 0:39:49.320000] a lot more manageable for me, personally,
[0:39:49.320000 -> 0:39:51.720000] but it did go, we went over time.
[0:39:51.720000 -> 0:39:52.560000] It's okay, though.
[0:39:52.560000 -> 0:39:53.400000] Don't worry about it.
[0:39:53.400000 -> 0:39:54.220000] Probably some more.
[0:39:54.220000 -> 0:39:55.680000] You have to think about getting into this.
[0:39:55.680000 -> 0:39:57.760000] We were thinking, Christine and I were thinking
[0:39:57.760000 -> 0:39:58.600000] it might be okay.
[0:39:58.600000 -> 0:39:59.440000] It might get there.
[0:39:59.440000 -> 0:40:03.100000] That's what we were thinking when it was ready.
[0:40:03.320000 -> 0:40:04.160000] Um.
[0:40:05.280000 -> 0:40:07.800000] We're sorry that we ran out of time.
[0:40:07.800000 -> 0:40:09.760000] The others didn't share about the learning
[0:40:09.760000 -> 0:40:10.680000] and their teaching.
[0:40:10.680000 -> 0:40:13.080000] In our group, there was a lot of interesting.
[0:40:13.080000 -> 0:40:13.920000] Yeah.
[0:40:13.920000 -> 0:40:16.120000] Do you think we could type what we've heard today?
[0:40:17.360000 -> 0:40:18.200000] We can.
[0:40:18.200000 -> 0:40:22.300000] I mean, I feel like, I hand wrote notes on the pages.
[0:40:24.320000 -> 0:40:27.960000] In a Word document, eventually having all their responses
[0:40:27.960000 -> 0:40:30.760000] or comments about reading.
[0:40:30.760000 -> 0:40:31.660000] We can.
[0:40:31.660000 -> 0:40:32.500000] Whatever you think.
[0:40:32.520000 -> 0:40:33.360000] I mean.
[0:40:35.240000 -> 0:40:36.840000] Whatever you think.
[0:40:36.840000 -> 0:40:40.800000] I mean, mine are horribly, I mean, I wrote very fast.
[0:40:40.800000 -> 0:40:41.640000] Yeah.
[0:40:41.640000 -> 0:40:43.720000] The kids were like, oh my gosh, you write so fast.
[0:40:43.720000 -> 0:40:45.480000] I'm like, what did you speak a lot?
[0:40:46.600000 -> 0:40:49.880000] I don't have as much, there's not as much.
[0:40:49.880000 -> 0:40:52.200000] I was going through it a bit quicker than you were,
[0:40:52.200000 -> 0:40:55.920000] so there's not as much comments to write about.
[0:40:55.920000 -> 0:40:58.320000] But I'm happy to type up what I did.
[0:40:58.320000 -> 0:40:59.160000] We organized it.
[0:40:59.160000 -> 0:41:01.080000] Even Kevin can help us organize it.
[0:41:01.080000 -> 0:41:01.920000] Yeah.
[0:41:02.140000 -> 0:41:02.980000] Our handwriting.
[0:41:02.980000 -> 0:41:03.800000] Yeah.
[0:41:03.800000 -> 0:41:05.660000] But there was a lot of learning on our part.
[0:41:05.660000 -> 0:41:06.500000] Yes, for sure.
[0:41:06.500000 -> 0:41:08.220000] About their feelings about the stories
[0:41:08.220000 -> 0:41:09.580000] and reading and writing.
[0:41:09.580000 -> 0:41:10.860000] And I'm sure in the other team,
[0:41:10.860000 -> 0:41:12.700000] just write it in your learning notes,
[0:41:12.700000 -> 0:41:14.620000] and we'll talk more on Friday.
[0:41:14.620000 -> 0:41:16.500000] And thank you, Agustina, welcome to the group.
[0:41:16.500000 -> 0:41:17.340000] Yes, welcome.
[0:41:17.340000 -> 0:41:20.900000] Agustina's in my class, and she wants to learn
[0:41:20.900000 -> 0:41:22.540000] about the facts of knowledge of the children
