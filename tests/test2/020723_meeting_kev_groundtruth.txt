02/07/23

• 0:00 - 0:05 Belén
So it is now, like at the beginning that we have to, with Jason,

• 0:06 - 0:20 Patricia
I think one adult coming up, like if he were only you, Joe, coming up by yourself and moving quietly around the room I think would be fine. Sure. I mean, we, we could ask her or, or ask her, you know, do you mind if I come in? I have.

• 0:20 - 0:35 Cristina
Cause that, that was the, the thought process of sending an adult up here was to just make sure that like the classroom is ready so that we don't—and so that someone has eyes on it before we come in. So then when, before we leave, we can make sure it's the same. So like, I don't wanna,

• 0:36 - 0:38 Patricia
But today, right there were children. So it’s different.

• 0:38 - 0:40 Cristina
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

• 0:40 - 1:20 Patricia
She even said that, I'm not sure what the agreement was at the end. I think that she felt that Israel also should go downstairs. That Papa…Papa. Miss Papa? You call her <laugh> [Papadimia?] Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. She has a very long last name. Papa. Miss Papa that, um, she told her that, uh, Israel had permission to come up earlier, but, but she said, but she, I think she should, I'm gonna talk to her because she, he should still go downstairs. I'm gonna tell the parent and I said, well, I can talk to the parents. I didn't want to, you know. Make this a big—

• 1:20 - 1:25 Manuel
Because I got here. It was also, um, Jeremy and who else was up here?

• 1:25 - 1:26 Joe
Isabel, and—

• 1:26 - 1:39 Jada
Isabel? Yeah. Because they’re obviously class. So Yeah, I go down Papa, they told me to go downstairs, so I went downstairs to go to the cafeteria. Cause she was like, Jada, make sure you go down. So, okay. So I go down.

• 1:39 - 1:39 Patricia
For the program?

• 1:40 - 1:45 Jada
Yeah. But I guess I was, when we first started, she would just like help out with whatever transition or whatever. So that's why down down <laugh>. So on Tuesdays I don't dismiss my kids, but my co-teacher, she doesn't and I just go straight to the cafeteria yet.

• 2:00 - 2:17 Cristina
Which is also just a logistical thing to keep in mind, like, I feel like sometimes I'm gonna be late. I'm late to the gym to get kids because I'm coming from there. You know? Like just. Like, cuz I'm coming from here. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so just like something in case, you know,

• 2:18 - 2:21 Patricia
I mean Israel sometimes goes downstairs to get food.

• 2:21 - 2:24 Andrea
He went downstairs later. No, but, but I mean today

• 2:24 - 3:16 Jada
It’s a transition because they switch off. The one that's with him and for the program is not the Same one during the day. So I think they worked out an agreement that they will, she will wait here until she comes. Oh. Because she usually brings Israel down at 3:15 because the door over there opened at 3:15, 5 minutes before dismissal. And so maybe if, if, if there's like, um, if it's difficult to have him in the classroom, I can ask the daytime [?] if she can bring him down at maybe at 3:20 or 3:18 into the cafeteria so that Ms. K, I believe the other [?] can pick him up from there, as opposed to waiting here. We can do that as well. But I think it was just, they just thought that it would be much simpler to me in the classroom.

• 3:16 - 3:17 [Angela?]
Whatever works best for [?] as well, you know?

• 3:17 - 3:27 Patricia
It’s up to the needs of your co-teacher. And I want to make sure that, you know, that we don't ruin your relationship with your co-teacher. And it's not asking too much I think.

• 3:27 - 3:28
Sure.

• 3:28 - 3:58 Patricia
No. I mean, yeah. It's, it's easier to just stick around, but, but you know, the, it's a negotiation always. This is not our space. So, you know, also making sure when we come in that if she's here we say hello and we kind of say, can we come in? Or don't get too noisy if she is still here. I don’t know. Just be… she leaves because then she has to go to meetings, she said on Mondays and Tuesdays. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> not a big deal. Just, you know, she was just suggesting meetings and you know, asking politely, would it be okay to have those five minutes after school? So she comes back at 3:25. Yes. And she's doing this dismissal by herself. So maybe that load—

• 4:07 - 4:15 Jada
Sometimes later than 3:25 if she has to go across the street. So it could be like 3:28ish as well. Yeah.

• 4:16 - 4:33 Patricia
Yeah. That's about the logistics. Otherwise good. I think children were respectful with the space. And in the other class, Manuel, you took a photograph of Robin's class. Yeah. And everything is, yeah. Everything is already organized. Yeah. We didn't move a lot.

• 4:35 - 4:36 Andrea
Did you change the whiteboard?

• 4:37 - 4:38 Manuel
Yeah, I took the whiteboard.

• 4:39 - 4:45 Patricia
Jeremy here wanted to write the one on the <laugh> whiteboard marker. <laugh> Jeremy, ee haven't seen him for, for since the break. Right? He's been sick or something. [He’s been sick a lot.] He was here on Wednesday. Yeah. 

• 4:50 - 5:04 Manuel
But he was here on Wednesday. 

• 5:03 - 5:04 Patricia
Maybe on Wednesday, but I wasn’t here on Wednesday. So he was here Wednesday. Great, great.

• 5:03 - 5:04 Joe
I thought I saw him the week before.

• 5:04 - 5:08
Yeah. And I saw, I saw him the first week I went too.

• 5:08 - 5:11 Patricia
Yeah. Yeah. Probably. I hadn't seen him myself.

• 5:11 - 5:14 Joe
Yeah. He left my, uh, station today.

• 5:14 - 5:16 [?]
Yeah. He came to, he came, he's like, ¿no hay música?

• 5:18 - 5:26 Patricia
Oh, he was looking for the movement!

• 5:26 - 5:28 [?]
Left my team for… He went to get water, and he went. When he returned. He met Patricia,

• 5:38 - 6:00 Patricia
But that's okay. You know, we do want, uh, children in this space to feel they have some agency in choosing. It's interesting for us also to see how children maneuver the space and ask for things and try to make their interest happen in.

• 6:01 - 6:11 [?]
But he's much more receptive to like, redirection now. Also because the children with him redirect like some of the behavior.

• 6:11 - 6:12 
Jeremy?

• 6:12 - 6:12 
Yeah.

• 6:12 - 6:30 Jada
He has a lot of trauma. So we think it's a trauma response. But he shuts down. Like, you know, when I was saying, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy [mm-hmm.] <affirmative>. You say his name like five, six times and he just shuts down. We think it's because of trauma. So it's something that we're working with him.

• 6:30 - 6:34 [?]
But the children have been kind of like bringing him in. Like the second grade, was kind of funny. Like, yeah yeah yeah, it’s [your turn?].

• 6:35 - 6:39 Jada
Sometimes that'll work, sometimes it doesn't. So if it's working—

• 6:39 - 7:09 [?]
I think he feels like pretty comfortable. And I feel like because they're second graders perhaps he, he also feels like, you know, that's good— 

• 6:39 - 7:08 [?] 
And I also feel like usually when we go downstairs to wait for him to, to his mom or her dad, we usually wait like 10, 15 minutes and the three of us have been playing with him and those kinds of things. So I feel like just connecting with him is also helpful.

• 7:08 - 7:08
And Dariel.

• 7:09 - 7:31 [?]
Yes. But Dariel usually goes, but I feel like he's always been there to like, play a little. Yes. And like today too, their chemistry was pretty good. Yes. And anything he needs, like, cuz the kids will wanna speak English to each other, like the second graders. But then I'm like, EWS here too. Like let's, you know, try to also just speak in Spanish in general. But so that age will always be like that person to Yeah.

• 7:31 - 7:53 Christina
Well I think it also, like, sometimes it's helpful to have for them, like a purpose, like a reason why they have to be, you know, like a reason for them to speak Spanish. It, it's not just like me to tell us saying like, you need to speak Spanish, but it's like your friend! Yeah. We, we need to include your friend who's like here and wants to be part of the conversation. Like, that creates a very, you know, real reason versus just like—

• 7:53 - 7:55 Patricia
Authentic. Yeah.

• 7:55 - 8:04 Joe
But so with Jeremy, your, uh, your approach is, I'm just curious, like you say his name several times to get his attention or…?

• 8:04 - 8:52 Jada
<laugh>. Um, sorry, not to laugh, but, um, it's honestly for right now, what we've been doing is just trying to get his attention. And then when we get his attention, we say, buddy, I’ve been talking to you. Like, did you hear me? And he will say, no, I didn't or something. Um, so we just kind of just talk him through it. Um, and that seems to work. Um, and that seems to work. I think he was also maybe a little overstimulated. Um, and so today, yeah, today mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But he usually is in like a different world. So it's constant redirections with him, constant checking in with him. Um, even when the friends, which is why it's good that it's happening, that the kids are, um, talking to him. But even in class, the kids will go, he, he's not listening to me. I'm talking to him and he's just not listening. Yeah. So

• 8:53 - 9:00 Joe
I don't know if you were there the whole whole time when he was still at my station, but was there anything I did that you feel like might have overwhelmed him or like over stimulated

• 9:00 - 9:02 Jada
Him? No, not you. And not

• 9:02 - 9:05 Joe
Like you, the way it was running, that could have been different for him?

• 9:05 - 9:15 Jada
It was just like an exciting thing. Yeah. I don't think it was anything that, um, um, was necessarily done like incorrectly or anything like that.

• 9:15 - 9:17 Joe
Yeah. I was trying to get them excited. So it might have been an effect—

• 9:18 - 9:26 Patricia
It’s surprising right. That he would leave something that, for me, since we, I, we anticipating this would be the most exciting part for the children mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

• 9:26 - 9:34 Jada
He, I don't know. It's kind of like, I don't know if he like disassociates or dissociates disassociates or whatever, but, um—

• 9:35 - 10:03 Christina
And like also maybe like, I don't know, I feel like when, when you're already, when you've already been like at a heightened emotional state, like any, even like good things that bring you up can be overwhelming. Like it just gets overwhelming quickly. Um, and like some like maybe that just, it just was like, he got excited, which was good. Like is generally a good emotion, but just like for him became too much to him. You know? Like it just

• 10:03 - 10:12 Joe
Is what it, I do think part of it also was like, he didn't have the microphone the whole time. Like I was trying to get everybody's input and I, I saw him kind of like, get frustrated. Okay. It's okay. I didn't take it personally.

• 10:14 - 10:16
No, no. Yeah. I don't think he should have the microphone whole time.

• 10:18 - 10:21 Joe
I'm just trying to, trying to assess how to best navigate it. 

• 10:23 - 10:25 Patricia
You had enough children—

• 10:25 - 10:29 I think you did everything with all of the strategy and things that you were saying. I think it was justified.

• 10:30 - 10:51 Patricia
Also my like to make, take his own, you know, to make decisions. It [is] maybe the one space where he can decide, you know, I'm moving more freely or I have choices. And like in with Christina and I, we gave him the choice you want to work with Miss Christina with me? And he chose Christina. And, you know, it's hard to hear, but that's,

• 10:52 - 11:03 Christina
But it was also like, he played it really well. Cause you were like, God really, like, you don't wanna talk to me. He was like, and she was like, no, it's okay. I know, I know we're still friends, right? He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good, like a good bonding moment

• 11:03 - 11:30 Patricia
Yeah. Yeah. It was a good bonding moment. And then he was shaking hands with me. Like, it's fine. It's not that he doesn't, like, he was just, he's making decisions and being a person. In that process and trying it out and seeing how this works, and choose to go to another center. We did have, in the past, we had some time for children to choose to go to other centers. Yeah. So, you know, learn outs already out of our space to do that.

• 11:46 - 11:48
[....] We knew he was accounted for somewhere.

• 11:49 - 11:59 Patricia
Yeah. That worries me a little bit. Like at one point he left the room too. So I was, I followed him because what worries me, I mean, I don't know how often he might disappear.

• 11:59 - 12:27 Jada
He does it quite often. But he did ask, he asked somebody, I forget who he asked to get water and I had a conversation with him. Cause he recently started sitting on the bathroom floor and just zoning out. And so he like had a conversation. Make sure you go to the water, come back, don't go to the bathroom, don't go to the floor. Just come straight back. And that's when he saw you. I saw him see you, and I saw him see you. I saw you direct him and said or not like, talk to him and you went into the other room. So I was like, okay, he's fine. 

• 12:27 - 12:33 Patricia
But I told him, don't leave the room by yourself because we get scared. We don't know where you are.

• 12:33 - 12:34 Jada
Ohh, was he supposed to go with somebody?

• 12:35 - 12:36 Patricia
He was in our class.

• 12:36 - 12:38 Jada
He was supposed to be a water.

• 12:39 - 12:41 Patricia
He was coming from there. But he hadn't asked.

• 12:42 - 12:42 Jada
No, he asked!

• 12:42 - 12:43 Joe
He asked one of us,

• 12:44 - 12:46 Patricia
Oh he asked you. He came here?

• 12:46 - 12:49 Joe
He was our, he was in our, in my group originally.

• 12:49 - 12:58 Patricia
No, but this was when he was with us. Oh, and then he left again. [He left again?]; And I don't think he has permission in that. Because he was in our group. Right. Christina?

• 12:59 - 13:02 Christina
I don't, he was talking to me. He was talking to me the whole time so I don't think it was in our group.

• 13:04 - 13:07 Patricia
Maybe not. He, when he was at some point, I followed him.

• 13:07 - 13:16 Andrea
Maybe at the beginning, because we were saying to—

• 13:16 - 13:19 Jada
Maybe walk away, he zones out and he just walks away. But he doesn’t go far. He goes to the bathroom and gets water.

• 13:23 - 13:30 Andrea
I understand him. I do the same. Sometimes my husband is talking to me and I'm not listening.

• 13:32 - 13:47 Patricia
This happens. We have, in my son's class. There's a boy that also leaves the classroom for the bathroom mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And he disappears for two hours and the certificate. But he gets very worried he needs [?]. He has also a very complicated life—

• 13:47 - 13:59 Andrea
Then we have talked about this before, that, um, at least on my impression is like he's still adjusting to have a routine and to like learn [Yes] the rules and the procedures and what is supposed to be done. So I think that sometimes he's on that mood. Like most kids like ask permission, follow the instruction. But sometimes it just—

• 14:18 - 14:36 Patricia
I, I just, um, I still don't know how much we can trust him. This is the issue. I would be happy if he goes by himself to the bathroom, to the, but I, you know, I also feel I guess responsible. But if we, if we think that we can trust him, yeah, totally fine. Especially if he had asked for permission to leave, that’s great.

• 14:37 - 14:38 Jada
Yeah. He, that's gotten better at like asking now he'll just ask to go one place and go another place too.

• 14:49 - 14:57 Patricia
I mean, he came back actually very responsive to what says now you feel that way?

• 14:57 - 15:21 Belén
Yeah. I mean, I, I was just seeing progress this semester because I feel like he's number one, he's not running away. Because running is very different than walking around. He also asked permission today to go scare the teacher next door. [Oh yeah. He, they scare each other!] But he asked for permission to do that. You know what I mean? It's, I found it hilarious. Well, can I go scare my teacher <laugh>?

• 15:22 - 15:56 Christina
I do. I feel, I agree. I think I've seen progress with him. Yeah. Like I've seen he's, and I think you're right. Like I think, I mean, I don't know. I can't, I feel like I can't be the one to be like, oh, it's trauma. But like, I think it seems like there's just like a lot going on in that kid's head. Yeah. And that he doesn't know what to do with probably mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, but I feel like I've seen him kind of like become a little bit more stable or like a little bit more, um, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, he, he doesn't fight me as much, fight us as much on things I think like mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, which has been good

• 15:58 - 16:18 Jada
When he, when we walked down, he doesn't run away or, yeah, because the first two weeks, he was…. [Great.]. Then I was holding his camp to go down. Now he just walks next to me and…

• 16:18 - 16:28 Belén
He plays, he knows that there's gonna be play downstairs. Yes. He comes here and then he's playing around. Guess like the electric, whatever that was, the shop. And then the guess what my pizza, what food I have. Yeah.

• 16:28 - 16:34 Patricia
Pizza get so bad. He's like, should I throw it away? I'm like, oh, this seems cold. He took another bite

• 16:35 - 16:42 Belén
He walks around and asked almost everybody like, yeah, what do you think is in my pizza. Like, what are you…

• 16:43 - 16:47 Joe
Dariel came was like, it's cheese pizza.

• 16:49 - 17:01 Patricia
So let's talk about today's learning and, and session. And let's start with a start. Today may, at some point you have to tell about your, the story of your tattoos. Yeah.

• 17:04 - 17:07 Joe
I didn't mean to make that a focus of, of today's

• 17:07 - 17:09 Patricia
Well, they very, you know, because you're wearing sleeves

• 17:10 - 17:10 Joe
It was too hot.

• 17:11 - 17:13 [?]
No, that's fine. Right. That's it was very moment.

• 17:16 - 17:18
It was just so funny. Like the kids are like,

• 17:18 - 17:27 Joe
We were all having fun. Um, they're, um, film roles, this medium format film. Um, so this one's a full roll and this one's an empty roll.

• 17:27 - 17:28 Patricia
Oh, so it's connected!

• 17:29 - 17:32 Joe
Yeah. And yeah, it's connect. I guess I could have told them.

• 17:32 - 17:37 Patricia
Would've, it's actually a good connection that they realize is so important for you and you are sharing this with them.

• 17:37 - 17:40 Joe
Maybe I'll bring it up in front of them.

• 17:40 - 17:42 Manuel
I generally thought they were like cans or something.

• 17:42 - 17:45 Joe
<laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. No, everyone thinks they're something else.

• 17:45 - 17:46 Manuel
Campbell Chicken Soup or something. <laughs>

• 17:52 - 17:57 Joe
A cop thought I was military. He thought this was one. This was a one. I was like, no. <laugh>, no.

• 17:52 - 17:57 Christina
If anything was two, because it looks like two. Like an ar Roman numerals.

• 18:03 - 18:07 Patricia
It's just very ancient. Like nowadays we don't see,

• 18:07 - 18:09 Joe
Yeah, I'm part of the, the first battalion, Roman legions <laugh>.

• 18:14 - 18:20 Andrea
Well, you can ask them to guess what they are. Yeah. Don't tell them. What do you think? If and if they're connected,

• 18:21 - 18:22 Joe
I can tell them. Yeah.

• 18:22 - 18:32 Patricia
And that would be a good guess. And find out. So, um, Joe, I want to hear about your, your group and the learning that you socially look at the people first or after.

• 18:33 - 18:34 Joe
I'll talk about it first and then we can

• 18:34 - 18:35 Patricia
Okay. Let's, yeah. Um, so movie afterwards

• 18:37 - 19:13 Joe
I wanna hear what you guys think of how the up here with the whole group went. I thought it went pretty well. But, um, in the small group over there, course, um, the hardest part was definitely getting them to, uh, agree on different things that they were proposing. But once they had, like, once I was like, okay, you've suggested a dog, you've suggested a cat. Let, we're doing a dog and a cat. They started to be like, oh, and they could have a treat, and like the cat gets a treat. And then Kaylee suggested, um, maybe they, they're fighting over a treat and they, they have to share it. And then, uh, someone else was like, no, no, no. They each get a treat of their own. And they, and they're, and then I, I started to move on like, okay, we know the stories about a dog and a cat. Where is this taking place? Then they were like, it's at a park. And then they were like, okay. So the, the dog goes across the slide or down the slide and they have the monkey bars. And it came together as we went. But, uh, Israel was upset that we didn't put a, at first he was upset that we didn't put a, a human character in. He wanted a human character. But then, and he was, he, he's the one that made the dog and he kept saying, uh, it's really ugly. Um, stuff like that. [Israel?].

• 19:53 - 19:55 Andrea
Oh, that's why he wanted to draw white dog!

• 19:55 - 19:57 Joe
Yeah. So did you practice it with him later?

• 19:57 - 20:29 Andrea
Oh, we talked about it. [Okay.] So he, he saw me that I was drawing a dog for Kelsey mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And he was really mad, but like, I was able to draw with Kelsey not with him, I say, okay, let's sit down and I'll show you how I did it. So we sat down and explained that it's not that I made it, I just copied it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So we talk about copying things like inspiring us. So we have the, and we did, because I did it with Kelsey. We did half and half. I did like the main form of the dog, and they made all the little details,

• 20:35 - 20:39 Joe
The features. [Yeah.] Did you look up like something online and, and copy for that?

• 20:39 - 20:51 Andrea
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. We had a picture of a dog I put there. Yeah. And I just did, and then we did a little spelling because he wanted to write my name and his name as the authors <laugh>.

• 20:52 - 21:24 Joe
Yeah. So after we finished, because I was kind of trying to rush to the next animation, we didn't end up having time for it, but at the end, he kept, he was trying to draw another dog and, and was saying, it's ugly. And I was like, I don't think I kept telling him like, we just need to practice. I don't think it's ugly. Like, we, like, the first dog I drew, I thought was ugly too. And I, I asked him like, do you want me to draw a dog? And I drew one, you know, very quickly. And he was like, oh, it looks great. And I was like, uh, I was like, well, the first one I drew wasn't great. And he, but that still prompted him to like, start drawing more.

• 21:24 - 21:34 Andrea
Yeah. I told him the same. Like, I don't know how to draw those. I just know how to copy the Yeah. Without the image, I wouldn't be able to do that.

• 21:34 - 21:48 Joe
Yeah. After I drew my little sketch, he copied that one and then he did another one of his own. But I think from the beginning to the end, he was, he understood at least that he had gotten better, whether or not he still thought his dogs were ugly <laugh>. But—

• 21:48 - 22:01 Patricia
Yeah, that's artistic part, right? Um, mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I'm trying to imagine how a dog looks like and trying to mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like, that's artistic process. I don't want to take away. Right. You are not <inaudible>. So

• 22:01 - 22:17 Joe
Right. You don't want to, you don't want to guide them too much. But like, I was asking questions like, what, what do a dogs here look like? Are they pointy or are they flopping down? And he was like, think of something to think about. But um, as you can see, his dog doesn't have ears. But—

• 22:18 - 22:44 Andrea
Yeah, we talk about the shapes. So, because he was worried of doing it. So what I did, I, we talk about the shapes, like he could see on the drawing. So now he, like, on this, oh, okay. This is a circle. Yeah. So we start with a circle, and the ears look like what? Say they look like hotdog bread. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> like brand, they hotdog bread

• 22:48 - 22:49 Joe
Giving those names to the shapes

• 22:52 - 22:54 Patricia
The survival strategy.

• 22:55 - 23:07 Christina
I do feel like, I mean, I get, I like, I get it. Cause when I was a kid, I would, I would get so frustrated when my drawings didn't look the way that I thought they would in my head. So it just like, you know, it's hard. That's all.

• 23:07 - 23:32 Joe
Yeah. And so, yeah. So Kelsey was there. She drew the cat. Um, and, and he was like, comparing Israel was comparing his dog to her cat. And you know, was saying like, well she, she's practiced drawing a cat a lot then. Um, and she was saying that like, Kaylee's perfect k, Kaylee's perfect at everything. Her teacher thinks she's perfect. And Kaylee was like, no, what? Talking about like, I'm not perfect. I was like, no one is.

• 23:32 - 23:33 Patricia
Who said that, Israel?

• 23:33 - 23:53 Joe
No. Um, uh, Kelsey was saying that Kaylee is perfect at everything. And I was like, no one's perfect at everything. Um, we had a small conversation about practicing makes you better, but nobody's ever perfect at anything. Um, but you wanna watch it? Yeah. Yeah. It's five, five seconds long. [Oh!] Yeah. So they also wanted to throw the treats in the, in the garbage at the end, rather than having them eat them–

• 24:04 - 24:05
[Again! De nuevo!] Wow.

• 24:07 - 24:10 Joe
So they go over the monkey bars is over the slide

• 24:12 - 24:13
That's so cute.

• 24:13 - 24:16 Patricia
Beautiful. And I don't think that dog is sad.

• 24:16 - 24:19 Joe
I don't think so either. I I think it's clear that it's a dog. Yeah.

• 24:19 - 24:29 Patricia
And it's a first sketch. Right. And if he doesn't draw just from his mind start drawing, then he would never feel like, my dogs are beautiful.

• 24:29 - 24:48 Joe
He was also drawing the Apple logo at one point because he had a laptop in front of him. And I was telling him, like, he was like, it doesn't look like that one. I was like, yeah, no, but it's more interesting. I've seen that one all over. I see that one everywhere, all over the world. Um, but that one, that one's different. That one's unique. And he was like, yeah, but it's ugly.

• 24:48 - 25:13 Andrea
But yeah, I told him that he, uh, like the idea of drawing was for him to practice because drawing is difficult and you need to know your forums and some, because we did a lot of erasing mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then like, you have to erase and redo it and it's okay. And then you can try again, again and again, the more practice, the better you get.

• 25:14 - 25:19 Joe
Yeah. But also sometimes ugly things are, are good art. Are good art.

• 25:19 - 25:33 Patricia
We pay thousands for art [that is ugly]. But you know, with abstract art, sometimes at the beginning, my look… I mean it's very relative. Right. What we like or not.

• 25:35 - 25:37 Computer
I didn't get that. Could you try again? <laugh>

• 25:40 - 26:11 Jada
I think, um, I can't remember what it is in English. Why do I wanna say the do person? Peter Reynolds. Peter Reynolds. Ish. Ish? Both books, but ish. Okay. Okay. I think it's ish, the main character is making a drawing and then they crumble it up and throw it to the floor and do it again. Throw it to the floor and do it again. Throw it to the floor. It's about like, perseverance and like not giving up. So maybe if you guys wanna have to read. Well, not you guys, but yeah. If you want to!

• 26:11 - 26:20 [?]
 And it's like, it's called Ish because the kid is like, well it looks like a dog, ish. It looks like—ish.

• 26:23 - 26:24
<affirmative>. Oh, I like that.

• 26:25 - 26:35
They have Spanish class. Casi. I don't know what the character's name was. I can't remember. Yeah.

• 26:40 - 27:11 Patricia
But it is really getting into that with art. You just, at the beginning, you just don't enjoy it because you feel so bad at it and you're always like judging your own versus somebody else. That is much better. But like my daughter started drawing and painting during the pandemic. She had never done it before. And yeah, in the beginning she felt very uncomfortable, but she ended up creating a portfolio two years later for LaGuardia and she got into fine art. [Oh wow.] Because of her art. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And she never felt very confused. And she, Peter, Peter Renos, she started spending hours <affirmative>. So, you know, if we can get them to just enjoy giving that process, I mean, I think that's a beautiful dog, it’s so unique.

• 27:19 - 27:49 Joe
Yeah. I think just continuing to reinforce the message of like, you know, keep practicing. Um, and there's, and and also that message of like, ugly things aren't bad art, they're just different. Sometimes people like that more, you know? It looks like an original Israel piece. It's not like anything anyone else would draw. And like, seeing the value in that. I dunno, as long as we all have that same, like, messaging, I think because they're not gonna just stop being like, it's ugly. That's, that's just, yeah. That goes through high school, throughout, you know.

• 27:54 - 28:48 [?]
But I feel like he needs, I was just thinking last week when we were needing that, he said something like mm-hmm. Para hacer esto se necesita mucha paciencia. And, yo no tengo paciencia. And, and like yeah, <laugh>. And then like, if you keep talking to him, then he like, oh, okay. So, and I was telling him, do you remember when we did with Manuel? Like the process of something? And I remember he drew, eh, a lime tree or something like that. And I told him, you have, you have like a lot of patience doing that. And, and he was like, oh yeah! And he was like, oh yeah, hay que tener paciencia. So I think he needs that push at the beginning.

• 28:49 - 28:49 Patricia
Especially with these children, I don't know why it just works so wonderfully to remind them what this is learning. This is important for us. You want to be learning. You want to ask for more opportunities to learn or why are we, what is bilingual? We why bilingual? You ask that question today. It's an important question to remind them. It's not that they don't know, but did,

• 29:09 - 29:23 Joe
Did the connection make any sense? The connection I was trying to make between like different languages of storytelling and being bilingual in general. I don't know if that I spent enough time on that, but I was trying to connect with.

• 29:23 - 29:24 Patricia
Different ways of narrating.

• 29:24 - 29:30 Joe
 Yeah. I might have used the wrong, the wrong, uh,

• 29:30 - 29:37 Belén
I feel like I, I got it like as an adult, but I don't know. Maybe some kids probably did, some maybe not. But—

• 29:37 - 29:38 Joe
I think as long as it made sense, to the adults.

• 29:40 - 29:43 Patricia
Because they bilingual, they don't have two ways of narrating?

• 29:43 - 29:49 Joe
Um, yeah, I was thinking like, like storytelling in the ways of. Yeah. Yeah. The ways that they [?], that's one language of storytelling, whereas animation is another language of storytelling. Yeah. 

• 29:49 - 30:06 Patricia
You said there are, uh, multiple languages and we can, yeah. Yes. I don't know, I didn't make the connection immediately, but now that you're backing up,

• 30:06 - 30:12 Joe
But hopefully it'll, that'll happen in their heads too. Not that importan.

• 30:12 - 30:15 Patricia
So what, what's the learning that you saw in your group today?

• 30:15 - 30:48 Joe
Um, I'd say the, the big part the was Israel, uh, seeing that that growth in him of, uh, coming from like, it's ugly and I give up to, it's ugly, but it's better than the last one. Like, he didn't say that, but it seemed to be more of his attitude at the end. Um, and I think, uh, doing the, they, they learned a lot of patience or at least became more patient as they went along with, um, on the floor there. Because at first they were like, okay, we wanna move it over there.And I'm like, no, if you do it fast, it's not gonna, the animation isn't gonna work. So I had to do a few, um, photos for them.

• 30:56 - 31:02 Patricia
I see. Because to move it to this side, you have to take all these pictures…the delaying the reward, which is so important for academic learning. Yeah.

• 31:11 - 31:26 Joe
But yeah. And then they even understood at the end that like, um, in order to make them get to the trashcan fast, they don't, they don't just jump over there, but they do go faster. They're not, they're not like doing the same speed that they were doing the first time.

• 31:27 - 31:29 Patricia
Oh, because they're sliding down or…?

• 31:29 - 31:36 Joe
Um, just like when they, when they jumped up onto the slide or like, different moments, they were like, yeah, they're jumping so they go faster! They had logic to it, but yeah. Yeah.

• 31:44 - 32:00 [?]
Maybe we can show them tomorrow that at the beginning so they can see what the other showing. Yes. 

• 32:00 - 32:03 Patricia
This is great. Two groups’ work? [This is one group. One group.] One group. Um, why did you not have human beings? People? That is, that Israel one.

• 32:05 - 32:20 Joe
I didn't say that we couldn't. I just said that we have, we have an idea, uh, here of a dog and a cat. Let's start with that. And like, let's, let's start to think about the story. And I, I kept saying, like I said several times, like we can put a person in. 

• 32:20 - 32:22 Manuel
But you decided to draw a dog

• 32:22 - 32:28 Joe
Yeah, he made the dog. No. So he got, he was distracted by other things and then he made the trash can.

• 32:28 - 32:30 Patricia
So you were accepting of the idea.

• 32:30 - 32:35 Joe
But yeah, I wasn't saying they can't have the person, but other students were saying like, no, just the dog and a act.

• 32:35 - 32:38 Patricia
Oh, they felt that they didn't want to be a person.

• 32:38 - 32:48 Joe
Well, they wanted it, it to be either just a cat or just a dog. And I was like, I think it makes sense to have a story about a cat, a dog. I don't know. I was just trying to get them to mm-hmm. <affirmative> get the ball rolling on storytelling mm-hmm <affirmative>.

• 32:49 - 33:15 Patricia
No, I was thinking about representation, making sure that everybody's ideas are there and recognized and valued equally. Right. So thinking about how that process was, how they decided on the cat, on the dog. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, because sometimes it's, uh, you know, I had children that said, I, I don't want to draw human beings. I don't, I'm not good at drawing humans. They, I, they want to draw animal, dog. I don't know. In this case it doesn't see me.

• 33:15 - 33:22 Joe
N. Yeah. I, I left it open, like, great, great. We can add a, a human to the, to the story, but I wanted

• 33:22 - 33:30 Patricia
That's good. Great. Any other, uh, in six minutes, any other learning? Hannah, would you like to share your insights? We pass? I know you were trying to grade. The grades keep disappearing.

• 33:37 - 33:58 Hannah
I have like a couple of thoughts. One about, eh, like I really, really like these like, sort of longer term projects too for them and like maybe having some sort of gallery walk or like, some thing at the end of the week where they can…

• 33:58 - 34:03 Patricia
[whisper] Oh my gosh, which reminds me that we could do something like this. Sorry for interrupting here. We have, have you seen this? The inquiry project gallery for a student’s integrative project. And this is a system that we could create with the little movies. See, it says this is about bilingual children and preservice teachers. And you can look at the different presentations and mm-hmm. <affirmative> and you can go into different virtual rooms, like, okay, I got, sorry, I'm, I'm in the bottom. Let me go up, uh, here's the door and go to another room. And here are more [?] about bilingual identity development in language and interest practices. And I can move around, I can look at the presentation, I can give them feedback.

• 34:38 - 34:42 Joe
That could be a fun thing to do on the board. But I think like if we do it all on their computers, it might be kind chaotic.

• 34:44 - 34:46 Hannah
So like, just maybe having something like at the end of every week, like, just like five or 10 minutes at the end of the session every week so they can celebrate their work and see everything that they've done over the course of the time. Especially if there's like a longer term project. Um, cuz I feel like yeah, they're at the age where it's like they're super, super proud of something they work on over… 

• 35:12 - 35:14 Patricia
Yeah. And we haven't been doing that
   
• 35:14 - 35:54 Hannah
…a longer time, like two weeks or whatever. And they make a big product at the end. Eh, and the other thing is similar to somebody was adding onto like a way to share more with the families. I don't know, like making a drive or something that they can check and see the work that the students are doing. Like uploading pictures and like sending things home a lot. Um, like I know you guys already have some days where they can come in, but just like having a place where they can also look and check on what the kids are doing. I think, uh, like when we do stuff like that, the parents really appreciate it.

• 36:01 - 36:03 Patricia
So they have access to like Google Drive?

• 36:04 - 36:09 Hannah
Yeah, like if you just send like a, a note or whatever with, um, code or something.

• 36:10 - 36:19 Patricia
We haven't been to in, in past years. I've done that in other after school sending a flyer home once a month or week. Photographs of the activities and [Yeah.] Through the news.

• 36:19 - 36:24 Hannah
Yeah, exactly. Does some, some form of that. Like either a drive or like a collage or something like that I think is really good.

• 36:28 - 36:38 Patricia
And we have to think about bringing the parents because it's, it's been, they came once really, cuz then things got interrupted. So Yeah. We think about that connection with the parents. I miss them too.

• 36:38 - 36:44 Hannah
Yeah. Especially stuff like this is like really nice and the kids will be so excited to show their parents.

• 36:45 - 36:51 Christina
Yeah. This is, I feel like makes a lot of sense to have this really be something that we can like we invite them back

• 36:51 - 37:16 Patricia
Yeah. Thank you for the reminder. Mm-hmm. We kind of forgetting half of what, where learning happens. Mm-hmm. I know it's present and it just hasn't happened before [?] go back to it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, any other insights or? Are we, are we adding music, sound? Are we writing about this? What, what do you think? Are we, we could take use out of this more?

• 37:16 - 37:19 Joe
We can do a music session. Yeah. Or some sort of music workshop next to acting.

• 37:22 - 37:25 Andrea
Ah yeah. Dylan ask me if they can add music to the video.

• 37:25 - 37:28 Joe
Awesome. Yeah.

• 37:29 - 37:31 Andrea
Yeah, he wanted to add I believe…

• 37:33 - 37:41 Patricia
And words? Is Christina’s turn after Joe’s, she can continue the…

• 37:41 - 37:47 Christina
I don't know if you have like, any ideas about what that might look like or how we might do that, but we can, we can talk about it, think about it.

• 37:48 - 37:56 Joe
It then. I mean it could be as simple as like pick a song that, you know, and then I could go and like put it on underneath the, the video.

• 37:56 - 38:04 Manuel
Or like if donor writes something, it could be like two characters in a conversation. They can have like speech bubbles. They just put the speech ball for a few picture's and take it away and change it. [Physically?] Yeah. If it's something like…

• 38:12 - 38:13 Joe
Do a speech bubble and write it? [Just record it.] Or they could record it. [...] Yeah, we could record audio. I also have a speech. We have the own language written.

• 38:23 - 38:27 Patricia
They could record audio and also have speech bubbles, we have the oral language, the written language…

• 38:23 - 38:27 Christina
There are also like programs on computers that

• 38:27 - 38:28 Joe
You can for music making.

• 38:28 - 38:29 Chrstina
Yeah. Like simple.

• 38:30 - 38:31 Joe
There are, yeah.

• 38:31 - 38:33 Christina
I don't know a lot about it. We can look into it.

• 38:33 - 38:36 Patricia
I mean if PowerPoint would allow you to record audio.

• 38:37 - 38:42 Joe
Yeah. But there are some, like some tools that you can use to make like simple beats and like, you know,

• 38:42 - 38:47 Christina
Little like keyboard. Like a little, yeah. Almost like a, like a mini, there's like different core programs on computers I think.

• 38:47 - 38:51 Belén
Yeah. I mean if it's short there are lots of free ones. But then if they're longer then they have the paywall.

• 38:53 - 38:55 Joe
Well these are five seconds long <laugh>

• 38:55 - 39:14 Patricia
But there's a lot of beauty in that. And there's a sequence and you know, it's a narrative text it’s a visual text. So you keep saying, you know, it's only five seconds only, but we are very impressed. Right? [Oh yeah, I know!] No, I mean super movie.

• 39:14 - 39:14 Joe
There's a lot in it.

• 39:14 - 39:24 Patricia
There you go. You know, it's just the beginning. I think that the children will generate new ideas from this work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> seeing this one.

• 39:26 - 39:26 Joe
It was fun.

• 39:27 - 39:29 [?]
It was fun to watch. <laugh>.

• 39:30 - 39:51 Joe
Yeah. The last time I ran this, it was like a workshop, uh, on like a steam event day. And I had different groups of like five, fourth and fifth graders coming every 15 minutes. So like, I would finish with one, another one would come. So running one today and one tomorrow feels a lot more manageable for me personally. But it did go, we went over time.

• 39:51 - 40:15
It’s okay though. Don't worry about it.

• 40:17 - 40:23 Patricia
[...] Can we handwrite all we heard today? In a Word document eventually having all their responses or comments about reading,

• 40:29 - 40:35 [?]
Writing. Sure. We can, whatever you think. I mean, whatever you think

• 40:36 - 40:46 Patricia
<laugh>. I mean mine are horribly. I mean I wrote very fast. Yeah. The kids were like, oh my God, you write so fast. I'm like, what? What do you do, speak a loooooot <laugh>?

• 40:46 - 40:58 Christina
I feel like I don't have like as much. Um, there's not as much I went, I was going through it a bit quicker than you were. So like I don't, there's not as much comments to write about. Okay. But I'm happy to type up what I did.

• 40:58 - 41:05 Patricia
Right. We organize it. Even Kevin can help us organize it if you [?] our handwriting. Yeah. But there was a lot of learning on our part, the feelings about the stories and feeling and writing. And I'm sure in the other team, just write it in your learning notes and we'll talk more on Friday… 

[End]
