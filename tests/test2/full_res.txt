[ 00:00:00.000 -->  00:00:05.000] [SPEAKER_09] So it's now like at the beginning that we have to trace it?
[ 00:00:06.120 -->  00:00:09.760] [SPEAKER_05] I think one adult coming up, like if you were only you,
[ 00:00:09.760 -->  00:00:12.720] [SPEAKER_05] Joe, coming up by yourself and moving quietly
[ 00:00:12.720 -->  00:00:14.760] [SPEAKER_05] around the room, I think we'd be fine.
[ 00:00:14.760 -->  00:00:15.600] [SPEAKER_05] Sure.
[ 00:00:15.600 -->  00:00:17.140] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, we could pass her.
[ 00:00:17.140 -->  00:00:19.720] [SPEAKER_05] Or ask her, you know, do you mind if I come in?
[ 00:00:19.720 -->  00:00:21.320] [SPEAKER_05] I have to take a question.
[ 00:00:21.320 -->  00:00:24.200] [SPEAKER_07] That was the thought process of sending an adult up here
[ 00:00:24.200 -->  00:00:27.180] [SPEAKER_07] was to just make sure that like the classroom is ready
[ 00:00:27.180 -->  00:00:29.620] [SPEAKER_07] so that we don't, and so that someone has eyes on it
[ 00:00:30.240 -->  00:00:31.760] [SPEAKER_07] before we come in.
[ 00:00:31.760 -->  00:00:34.880] [SPEAKER_07] So then before we leave, we can make sure it's the same.
[ 00:00:34.880 -->  00:00:36.160] [SPEAKER_07] So like I don't wanna.
[ 00:00:36.160 -->  00:00:38.800] [SPEAKER_05] But today, there were children.
[ 00:00:38.800 -->  00:00:40.600] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ 00:00:40.600 -->  00:00:44.720] [SPEAKER_05] She even said that, I'm not sure what that woman was
[ 00:00:44.720 -->  00:00:47.060] [SPEAKER_05] at the end, I think that she felt that Israel
[ 00:00:47.060 -->  00:00:48.680] [SPEAKER_05] also should call them.
[ 00:00:48.680 -->  00:00:52.320] [SPEAKER_05] That Papa, Miss Papa, you call her?
[ 00:00:52.320 -->  00:00:53.160] [SPEAKER_05] Papa D.
[ 00:00:53.160 -->  00:00:54.060] [SPEAKER_05] Papa D.
[ 00:00:54.060 -->  00:00:55.280] [SPEAKER_05] Papa D.
[ 00:00:55.280 -->  00:00:57.640] [SPEAKER_05] She has a very long last name, Papa D.
[ 00:00:57.640 -->  00:00:59.760] [SPEAKER_05] Or Maria.
[ 00:01:00.920 -->  00:01:02.100] [SPEAKER_05] Miss Papa D.
[ 00:01:02.100 -->  00:01:06.500] [SPEAKER_05] That she told her that Israel had permission
[ 00:01:06.500 -->  00:01:08.180] [SPEAKER_05] to come up earlier.
[ 00:01:08.180 -->  00:01:10.620] [SPEAKER_05] But she said that she, I think she should,
[ 00:01:10.620 -->  00:01:13.260] [SPEAKER_05] I'm gonna talk to her because she should still go downstairs.
[ 00:01:13.260 -->  00:01:14.380] [SPEAKER_05] I'm gonna tell the para.
[ 00:01:14.380 -->  00:01:16.380] [SPEAKER_05] And I said, well, I can talk to the para.
[ 00:01:16.380 -->  00:01:19.380] [SPEAKER_05] I didn't want to, you know, make this a big.
[ 00:01:21.420 -->  00:01:22.260] [SPEAKER_07] Because we were only going here,
[ 00:01:22.260 -->  00:01:25.420] [SPEAKER_07] it was also Jeremy and who else was here?
[ 00:01:25.420 -->  00:01:27.540] [SPEAKER_02] Isabel and Israel, yeah.
[ 00:01:28.360 -->  00:01:29.200] [SPEAKER_03] Because we were all in the same class.
[ 00:01:29.200 -->  00:01:33.400] [SPEAKER_03] So, I have to go down, Papa D. told me to go downstairs.
[ 00:01:33.400 -->  00:01:35.720] [SPEAKER_03] So I went downstairs to go to the cafeteria
[ 00:01:35.720 -->  00:01:37.520] [SPEAKER_03] because she was like, Jada, make sure you go down.
[ 00:01:37.520 -->  00:01:38.880] [SPEAKER_03] So, okay.
[ 00:01:38.880 -->  00:01:39.720] [SPEAKER_01] So I go down.
[ 00:01:39.720 -->  00:01:40.540] [SPEAKER_01] For the program?
[ 00:01:40.540 -->  00:01:42.440] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, but I guess that was when we first started.
[ 00:01:42.440 -->  00:01:44.960] [SPEAKER_03] She was just like, help out with whatever,
[ 00:01:44.960 -->  00:01:45.800] [SPEAKER_03] transition or whatever.
[ 00:01:45.800 -->  00:01:47.280] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, she's always there helping us.
[ 00:01:47.280 -->  00:01:48.840] [SPEAKER_03] So that's why I go down.
[ 00:01:48.840 -->  00:01:51.120] [SPEAKER_03] Because she was like, go down.
[ 00:01:51.120 -->  00:01:53.520] [SPEAKER_03] So on Tuesdays, I don't dismiss my kids with my coach
[ 00:01:53.520 -->  00:01:54.560] [SPEAKER_03] until she does it.
[ 00:01:54.560 -->  00:01:56.920] [SPEAKER_03] And I just go straight to the cafeteria.
[ 00:01:57.100 -->  00:01:58.020] [SPEAKER_05] Yes, yes.
[ 00:01:58.020 -->  00:01:58.860] [SPEAKER_05] I went to make sure we.
[ 00:01:58.860 -->  00:02:01.660] [SPEAKER_07] Which is also a logistical thing to keep in mind.
[ 00:02:01.660 -->  00:02:05.300] [SPEAKER_07] Like, I feel like sometimes I'm gonna be late,
[ 00:02:05.300 -->  00:02:06.960] [SPEAKER_07] I'm late to the gym to get kids
[ 00:02:06.960 -->  00:02:08.220] [SPEAKER_07] because I'm coming from there.
[ 00:02:08.220 -->  00:02:09.300] [SPEAKER_07] You know, like just.
[ 00:02:10.340 -->  00:02:11.740] [SPEAKER_07] From the ambulance?
[ 00:02:11.740 -->  00:02:14.620] [SPEAKER_07] No, from that, like, because I'm coming from here.
[ 00:02:15.780 -->  00:02:18.580] [SPEAKER_07] So just like something in case, you know.
[ 00:02:18.580 -->  00:02:21.540] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, Israel sometimes goes downstairs to get food.
[ 00:02:21.540 -->  00:02:23.380] [SPEAKER_09] He went downstairs later.
[ 00:02:23.380 -->  00:02:24.220] [SPEAKER_09] Yes.
[ 00:02:24.220 -->  00:02:25.060] [SPEAKER_09] No, but I mean today.
[ 00:02:25.060 -->  00:02:26.900] [SPEAKER_03] It's a transition because.
[ 00:02:27.760 -->  00:02:29.240] [SPEAKER_03] They switch off.
[ 00:02:29.240 -->  00:02:31.080] [SPEAKER_03] The one that's with him for the program
[ 00:02:31.080 -->  00:02:32.480] [SPEAKER_03] is not the same one during the day.
[ 00:02:32.480 -->  00:02:34.320] [SPEAKER_03] Oh no, it's not the same one.
[ 00:02:34.320 -->  00:02:36.120] [SPEAKER_03] So I think they worked out an agreement
[ 00:02:36.120 -->  00:02:39.520] [SPEAKER_03] that she will wait here until she comes.
[ 00:02:39.520 -->  00:02:43.080] [SPEAKER_03] Because she usually brings Israel down at 3.15
[ 00:02:43.080 -->  00:02:45.360] [SPEAKER_03] because the door over there opens at 3.15,
[ 00:02:45.360 -->  00:02:47.240] [SPEAKER_03] five minutes before dismissal.
[ 00:02:47.240 -->  00:02:51.360] [SPEAKER_03] And so maybe if there's like,
[ 00:02:51.360 -->  00:02:54.040] [SPEAKER_03] if it's difficult to have them in the classroom,
[ 00:02:54.040 -->  00:02:56.880] [SPEAKER_03] I can ask the daytime power.
[ 00:02:57.720 -->  00:03:01.420] [SPEAKER_03] That she can bring him down at maybe at 3.20 or 3.18
[ 00:03:01.420 -->  00:03:04.460] [SPEAKER_03] into the cafeteria so that Miss K,
[ 00:03:04.460 -->  00:03:08.100] [SPEAKER_03] I believe the other power, can pick him up from there.
[ 00:03:08.100 -->  00:03:09.900] [SPEAKER_03] As opposed to waiting here.
[ 00:03:09.900 -->  00:03:11.640] [SPEAKER_03] We can do that as well.
[ 00:03:11.640 -->  00:03:13.060] [SPEAKER_03] But I think it was just, they just thought
[ 00:03:13.060 -->  00:03:16.180] [SPEAKER_03] that it would be much simpler to meet in the classroom.
[ 00:03:16.180 -->  00:03:17.660] [SPEAKER_07] Whatever works best for Miss Harper as well.
[ 00:03:17.660 -->  00:03:20.580] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, it doesn't meet the needs of your co-teacher
[ 00:03:20.580 -->  00:03:22.420] [SPEAKER_05] and I want to make sure that, you know,
[ 00:03:22.420 -->  00:03:25.500] [SPEAKER_05] that we don't ruin your relationship with your co-teacher.
[ 00:03:25.500 -->  00:03:27.400] [SPEAKER_05] And it's not asking too much, I think.
[ 00:03:28.760 -->  00:03:31.460] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, yeah, it's easier to just stick around.
[ 00:03:32.400 -->  00:03:34.960] [SPEAKER_05] But you know, it's a negotiation always.
[ 00:03:34.960 -->  00:03:36.080] [SPEAKER_05] This is not a space.
[ 00:03:36.080 -->  00:03:38.520] [SPEAKER_05] So you know, also making sure when we come in
[ 00:03:38.520 -->  00:03:40.440] [SPEAKER_05] that if she's here, we say hello
[ 00:03:40.440 -->  00:03:43.120] [SPEAKER_05] and we kind of say, can we come in?
[ 00:03:43.120 -->  00:03:45.400] [SPEAKER_05] Or don't get too noisy if she's still here.
[ 00:03:46.480 -->  00:03:49.040] [None] She lives here because then she has to go to meetings,
[ 00:03:49.040 -->  00:03:52.360] [SPEAKER_05] she said, on Mondays and Tuesdays.
[ 00:03:52.360 -->  00:03:53.880] [SPEAKER_05] Not a big deal, just, you know,
[ 00:03:53.900 -->  00:03:57.140] [SPEAKER_05] she was just suggesting meetings
[ 00:03:57.140 -->  00:03:58.620] [SPEAKER_05] and you know, asking politely,
[ 00:03:58.620 -->  00:04:01.980] [SPEAKER_05] would it be okay to have those five minutes after school?
[ 00:04:01.980 -->  00:04:04.420] [SPEAKER_05] So she comes back at 3.25.
[ 00:04:04.420 -->  00:04:06.220] [SPEAKER_05] Yes, and she's doing this meet-up by herself.
[ 00:04:06.220 -->  00:04:08.020] [SPEAKER_05] So maybe that load.
[ 00:04:08.020 -->  00:04:10.980] [SPEAKER_03] Sometimes later than 3.25, she has to go across the street.
[ 00:04:10.980 -->  00:04:15.980] [SPEAKER_03] So it could be like 3.28-ish as well, yeah.
[ 00:04:16.980 -->  00:04:20.180] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that's about the logistics.
[ 00:04:20.180 -->  00:04:22.220] [SPEAKER_05] Otherwise, good.
[ 00:04:22.680 -->  00:04:24.800] [SPEAKER_05] Children were respectful with the space.
[ 00:04:24.800 -->  00:04:27.080] [SPEAKER_05] And in the other class, Manuel,
[ 00:04:27.080 -->  00:04:29.480] [SPEAKER_05] you took a photograph of Robin's class.
[ 00:04:29.480 -->  00:04:30.320] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:04:30.320 -->  00:04:31.140] [SPEAKER_05] And everything is like that.
[ 00:04:31.140 -->  00:04:31.980] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, everything is already organized.
[ 00:04:31.980 -->  00:04:36.160] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, we didn't know a lot of the stuff.
[ 00:04:36.160 -->  00:04:37.680] [SPEAKER_09] Did you check the whiteboard?
[ 00:04:37.680 -->  00:04:38.520] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, I checked the whiteboard, yeah.
[ 00:04:38.520 -->  00:04:39.960] [SPEAKER_05] Because that's been the thing.
[ 00:04:39.960 -->  00:04:42.560] [SPEAKER_05] Jeremy here wanted to write on the board.
[ 00:04:42.560 -->  00:04:45.480] [SPEAKER_05] I think she was a whiteboard marker.
[ 00:04:47.120 -->  00:04:51.680] [SPEAKER_05] Jeremy, we haven't seen him since the break.
[ 00:04:52.620 -->  00:04:54.380] [SPEAKER_05] He's been sick a lot.
[ 00:04:54.380 -->  00:04:55.220] [SPEAKER_05] He's sick or something.
[ 00:04:55.220 -->  00:04:57.420] [SPEAKER_05] I think he was here this morning.
[ 00:04:57.420 -->  00:05:00.460] [SPEAKER_05] Maybe on Wednesday, yeah, but I wasn't here on Wednesday.
[ 00:05:00.460 -->  00:05:02.460] [SPEAKER_05] Okay, so he was here on Wednesday, great.
[ 00:05:03.820 -->  00:05:05.100] [SPEAKER_02] I thought I saw him the week before.
[ 00:05:05.100 -->  00:05:07.300] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, and I saw him the first week too.
[ 00:05:07.300 -->  00:05:08.420] [SPEAKER_05] On Wednesday too.
[ 00:05:08.420 -->  00:05:09.260] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:05:09.260 -->  00:05:10.180] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, probably.
[ 00:05:10.180 -->  00:05:11.620] [SPEAKER_05] I hadn't seen him myself.
[ 00:05:11.620 -->  00:05:14.580] [SPEAKER_02] He left my station today.
[ 00:05:14.580 -->  00:05:15.420] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, he came to us.
[ 00:05:15.420 -->  00:05:16.240] [SPEAKER_08] He came to us.
[ 00:05:16.240 -->  00:05:18.220] [SPEAKER_08] He's like, my musica?
[ 00:05:18.220 -->  00:05:20.260] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, he was looking for the movement.
[ 00:05:20.260 -->  00:05:21.100] [None] My musica.
[ 00:05:21.100 -->  00:05:21.920] [None] My musica.
[ 00:05:21.920 -->  00:05:22.760] [None] I think I remember.
[ 00:05:22.760 -->  00:05:25.600] [SPEAKER_02] Your team seemed very different.
[ 00:05:25.600 -->  00:05:27.200] [SPEAKER_02] When he left.
[ 00:05:27.200 -->  00:05:28.040] [SPEAKER_09] My team?
[ 00:05:28.040 -->  00:05:31.040] [SPEAKER_05] He asked for, he wanted to go to the toilet, to get water.
[ 00:05:31.040 -->  00:05:31.880] [SPEAKER_05] To get water.
[ 00:05:31.880 -->  00:05:32.720] [SPEAKER_08] No movement.
[ 00:05:32.720 -->  00:05:33.560] [SPEAKER_08] So, then when he returned.
[ 00:05:33.560 -->  00:05:35.400] [SPEAKER_08] No movement and acting.
[ 00:05:35.400 -->  00:05:37.680] [SPEAKER_08] He met Patricia and he went to her.
[ 00:05:37.680 -->  00:05:39.200] [SPEAKER_02] He's a runner, so.
[ 00:05:39.200 -->  00:05:41.800] [SPEAKER_05] But that's okay, you know, we do want children
[ 00:05:41.800 -->  00:05:45.200] [SPEAKER_05] in this space to feel they have some agency in choosing.
[ 00:05:45.200 -->  00:05:48.120] [SPEAKER_05] Jeremy might be overlooking it at times.
[ 00:05:48.120 -->  00:05:49.340] [None] I was like, oh no.
[ 00:05:49.340 -->  00:05:50.180] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:05:50.180 -->  00:05:51.000] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:05:51.000 -->  00:05:51.840] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:05:51.840 -->  00:05:52.660] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:05:52.660 -->  00:05:55.300] [SPEAKER_05] But it's interesting for us also to see
[ 00:05:55.300 -->  00:05:58.220] [SPEAKER_05] how children maneuver the space and ask for things
[ 00:05:58.220 -->  00:06:01.540] [SPEAKER_05] and try to make their interest happen.
[ 00:06:01.540 -->  00:06:04.020] [SPEAKER_08] But he's much more receptive to like,
[ 00:06:04.020 -->  00:06:06.100] [SPEAKER_08] redirection now.
[ 00:06:06.100 -->  00:06:10.660] [SPEAKER_08] Also because the children with him redirect like,
[ 00:06:10.660 -->  00:06:11.500] [SPEAKER_08] some of the behavior.
[ 00:06:11.500 -->  00:06:12.320] [SPEAKER_03] Jeremy?
[ 00:06:12.320 -->  00:06:13.160] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah.
[ 00:06:13.160 -->  00:06:15.900] [SPEAKER_03] He has a lot of trauma, so we think it's a trauma response.
[ 00:06:15.960 -->  00:06:17.240] [SPEAKER_03] When he like, shuts down.
[ 00:06:17.240 -->  00:06:21.880] [SPEAKER_03] Like, you know when I was saying Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
[ 00:06:21.880 -->  00:06:23.960] [SPEAKER_03] You say his name like, five, six times
[ 00:06:23.960 -->  00:06:26.080] [SPEAKER_03] and he just shuts down.
[ 00:06:26.080 -->  00:06:28.000] [SPEAKER_03] We think it's because of like, trauma.
[ 00:06:28.000 -->  00:06:30.680] [SPEAKER_03] So, it's something that we're working with.
[ 00:06:30.680 -->  00:06:33.040] [SPEAKER_08] But the children have been kind of like, bringing him in.
[ 00:06:33.040 -->  00:06:34.840] [SPEAKER_08] Like, the second period was kind of funny.
[ 00:06:34.840 -->  00:06:36.160] [SPEAKER_08] Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ 00:06:36.160 -->  00:06:38.080] [SPEAKER_03] Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.
[ 00:06:38.080 -->  00:06:38.920] [SPEAKER_03] So, if it's working, then it's great.
[ 00:06:38.920 -->  00:06:39.760] [SPEAKER_03] For sure.
[ 00:06:39.760 -->  00:06:43.200] [SPEAKER_08] I think he feels like, pretty comfortable
[ 00:06:43.220 -->  00:06:46.060] [SPEAKER_08] and I feel like because they're second periods perhaps,
[ 00:06:46.060 -->  00:06:48.900] [SPEAKER_08] he also feels like, you know, hands are scratched.
[ 00:06:48.900 -->  00:06:49.740] [SPEAKER_02] That's it.
[ 00:06:49.740 -->  00:06:50.580] [SPEAKER_02] Sorry.
[ 00:06:50.580 -->  00:06:54.300] [SPEAKER_06] And I also feel like, usually when we go downstairs
[ 00:06:54.300 -->  00:06:58.940] [SPEAKER_06] to wait for him to his mom or her dad,
[ 00:06:58.940 -->  00:07:01.180] [SPEAKER_06] we usually wait like, 10, 15 minutes
[ 00:07:01.180 -->  00:07:04.140] [SPEAKER_06] and the three of us have been playing with him
[ 00:07:04.140 -->  00:07:05.100] [SPEAKER_06] and those kind of things.
[ 00:07:05.100 -->  00:07:08.020] [SPEAKER_06] So, I feel like, just connecting with him is also helpful.
[ 00:07:08.020 -->  00:07:09.020] [SPEAKER_06] And Dariel.
[ 00:07:09.020 -->  00:07:11.700] [SPEAKER_08] Yes, but Dariel usually goes faster.
[ 00:07:11.720 -->  00:07:14.800] [SPEAKER_08] But I feel like he's always been there to play a little.
[ 00:07:14.800 -->  00:07:17.360] [SPEAKER_08] And today too, their chemistry was pretty good.
[ 00:07:17.360 -->  00:07:18.200] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, I know.
[ 00:07:18.200 -->  00:07:19.040] [SPEAKER_08] And anything he needs,
[ 00:07:19.040 -->  00:07:21.440] [SPEAKER_08] like, the kids will want to speak English to each other,
[ 00:07:21.440 -->  00:07:22.760] [SPEAKER_08] like the second graders.
[ 00:07:22.760 -->  00:07:24.640] [SPEAKER_08] But then I'm like, hey, he's here too.
[ 00:07:24.640 -->  00:07:27.680] [SPEAKER_08] Like, let's try to also just speak in Spanish in general.
[ 00:07:27.680 -->  00:07:30.960] [SPEAKER_08] But, so Dariel will always be that person to.
[ 00:07:30.960 -->  00:07:34.040] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah, well I think it also sometimes is helpful
[ 00:07:34.040 -->  00:07:36.320] [SPEAKER_07] to have for them a purpose,
[ 00:07:36.320 -->  00:07:37.440] [SPEAKER_07] like a reason why they have to be.
[ 00:07:37.440 -->  00:07:39.240] [SPEAKER_07] You know, like a reason for them to speak Spanish.
[ 00:07:39.380 -->  00:07:41.940] [SPEAKER_07] It's not just like, mean to us saying,
[ 00:07:41.940 -->  00:07:43.180] [SPEAKER_07] like, you need to speak Spanish.
[ 00:07:43.180 -->  00:07:45.340] [SPEAKER_07] But it's like, your friend.
[ 00:07:45.340 -->  00:07:46.780] [SPEAKER_07] We need to include your friend,
[ 00:07:46.780 -->  00:07:48.980] [SPEAKER_07] who's like here and wants to be part of the conversation.
[ 00:07:48.980 -->  00:07:51.180] [SPEAKER_07] Like, that creates a very, you know,
[ 00:07:52.660 -->  00:07:53.980] [SPEAKER_07] real reason versus just not.
[ 00:07:53.980 -->  00:07:54.820] [SPEAKER_07] Fending something.
[ 00:07:54.820 -->  00:07:55.660] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:07:55.660 -->  00:07:59.700] [SPEAKER_02] So, with Jeremy, your approach is,
[ 00:07:59.700 -->  00:08:02.660] [SPEAKER_02] I'm just curious, like, you say his name several times
[ 00:08:02.660 -->  00:08:03.820] [SPEAKER_02] to get his attention?
[ 00:08:05.460 -->  00:08:06.540] [SPEAKER_03] Sorry, that's a lot.
[ 00:08:06.560 -->  00:08:10.800] [SPEAKER_03] But it's honestly, for right now,
[ 00:08:10.800 -->  00:08:14.120] [SPEAKER_03] what we've been doing is just trying to get his attention.
[ 00:08:14.120 -->  00:08:15.400] [SPEAKER_03] And then when we get his attention,
[ 00:08:15.400 -->  00:08:17.240] [SPEAKER_03] we say, buddy, I've been talking to you.
[ 00:08:17.240 -->  00:08:18.840] [SPEAKER_03] Like, did you hear me?
[ 00:08:18.840 -->  00:08:21.640] [SPEAKER_03] And he'll say, no, I didn't, or something.
[ 00:08:21.640 -->  00:08:23.840] [SPEAKER_03] So we just kind of just talk him through it.
[ 00:08:25.480 -->  00:08:26.980] [SPEAKER_03] And that seems to work.
[ 00:08:28.240 -->  00:08:31.240] [SPEAKER_03] I think he was like, also maybe a little overstimulated.
[ 00:08:32.580 -->  00:08:33.900] [SPEAKER_03] And so. Today?
[ 00:08:33.900 -->  00:08:35.200] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, today.
[ 00:08:35.200 -->  00:08:38.020] [SPEAKER_03] But he usually is in a different world.
[ 00:08:38.020 -->  00:08:40.820] [SPEAKER_03] So it's constant redirections with him.
[ 00:08:40.820 -->  00:08:43.380] [SPEAKER_03] Constant checking in with him.
[ 00:08:43.380 -->  00:08:45.220] [SPEAKER_03] Even when the friends, which is why,
[ 00:08:45.220 -->  00:08:46.380] [SPEAKER_03] it's good that it's happening,
[ 00:08:46.380 -->  00:08:48.580] [SPEAKER_03] that the kids are talking to him.
[ 00:08:48.580 -->  00:08:49.900] [SPEAKER_03] But even in class, the kids will go,
[ 00:08:49.900 -->  00:08:50.980] [SPEAKER_03] Heddy's not listening to me.
[ 00:08:50.980 -->  00:08:53.180] [SPEAKER_03] I'm talking to him, and he's just not listening.
[ 00:08:53.180 -->  00:08:54.020] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah.
[ 00:08:54.020 -->  00:08:55.380] [SPEAKER_02] I don't know if he were there the whole time
[ 00:08:55.380 -->  00:08:56.780] [SPEAKER_02] when he was still at my station,
[ 00:08:56.780 -->  00:08:58.180] [SPEAKER_02] but was there anything I did
[ 00:08:58.180 -->  00:08:59.740] [SPEAKER_02] that you feel like might have overwhelmed him,
[ 00:08:59.740 -->  00:09:00.940] [SPEAKER_02] or overstimulated him?
[ 00:09:00.940 -->  00:09:02.780] [SPEAKER_02] No, not you, not like you.
[ 00:09:02.800 -->  00:09:04.000] [SPEAKER_02] The way it was running,
[ 00:09:04.000 -->  00:09:05.840] [SPEAKER_02] that could have been different for him.
[ 00:09:05.840 -->  00:09:08.120] [SPEAKER_03] It was just like an exciting thing.
[ 00:09:08.120 -->  00:09:09.840] [SPEAKER_03] I don't think it was anything that
[ 00:09:12.120 -->  00:09:15.400] [SPEAKER_03] was necessarily done incorrectly or anything like that.
[ 00:09:15.400 -->  00:09:16.920] [SPEAKER_02] I was trying to get them excited,
[ 00:09:16.920 -->  00:09:18.160] [SPEAKER_02] so it might have been.
[ 00:09:18.160 -->  00:09:19.640] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, but that's surprising, right?
[ 00:09:19.640 -->  00:09:22.120] [SPEAKER_05] That he would leave something that, for me,
[ 00:09:22.120 -->  00:09:24.240] [SPEAKER_05] seemed, I was anticipating this would be
[ 00:09:24.240 -->  00:09:26.680] [SPEAKER_05] the most exciting part for the children.
[ 00:09:26.680 -->  00:09:29.720] [SPEAKER_03] He, I don't know, it's kind of like,
[ 00:09:29.720 -->  00:09:31.200] [SPEAKER_03] I don't know if he dissociates,
[ 00:09:31.220 -->  00:09:33.700] [SPEAKER_03] or dissociates, or whatever.
[ 00:09:35.420 -->  00:09:39.060] [SPEAKER_07] And also maybe, I don't know, I feel like when
[ 00:09:41.180 -->  00:09:45.700] [SPEAKER_07] when you've already been at a heightened emotional state,
[ 00:09:45.700 -->  00:09:49.500] [SPEAKER_07] like even good things that bring you up
[ 00:09:49.500 -->  00:09:50.660] [SPEAKER_07] can be overwhelming.
[ 00:09:50.660 -->  00:09:52.620] [SPEAKER_07] It just gets overwhelming quickly.
[ 00:09:54.660 -->  00:09:56.900] [SPEAKER_07] And so maybe that, just it was like,
[ 00:09:56.900 -->  00:10:00.460] [SPEAKER_07] he got excited, which is generally a good emotion,
[ 00:10:00.520 -->  00:10:02.600] [SPEAKER_07] but just for him, became too much to handle.
[ 00:10:02.600 -->  00:10:03.440] [SPEAKER_07] You know, it just is what it is.
[ 00:10:03.440 -->  00:10:05.480] [SPEAKER_02] I do think a part of it also was like,
[ 00:10:05.480 -->  00:10:07.560] [SPEAKER_02] he didn't have the microphone the whole time.
[ 00:10:07.560 -->  00:10:09.480] [SPEAKER_02] Like I was trying to get everybody's input,
[ 00:10:09.480 -->  00:10:11.560] [SPEAKER_02] and I saw him kind of get frustrated.
[ 00:10:11.560 -->  00:10:12.400] [SPEAKER_02] That's okay.
[ 00:10:12.400 -->  00:10:14.200] [SPEAKER_02] It's okay, I never take it personally.
[ 00:10:14.200 -->  00:10:15.440] [SPEAKER_02] No, no, yeah, and I don't think
[ 00:10:15.440 -->  00:10:18.240] [SPEAKER_05] he should have the microphone the whole time.
[ 00:10:18.240 -->  00:10:21.960] [SPEAKER_02] I'm just trying to assess how to best navigate it.
[ 00:10:21.960 -->  00:10:23.680] [SPEAKER_05] You've had enough, too.
[ 00:10:23.680 -->  00:10:26.560] [SPEAKER_03] I think you did everything with all of the strategy
[ 00:10:26.560 -->  00:10:27.640] [SPEAKER_03] and things that he was saying,
[ 00:10:27.640 -->  00:10:30.160] [SPEAKER_03] I think it was justified, so.
[ 00:10:30.860 -->  00:10:34.220] [SPEAKER_05] He also might like to take his own,
[ 00:10:34.220 -->  00:10:35.620] [SPEAKER_05] you know, to make decisions.
[ 00:10:35.620 -->  00:10:38.940] [SPEAKER_05] It might be the one space where he can decide,
[ 00:10:38.940 -->  00:10:41.980] [SPEAKER_05] I'm moving more freely, or I have choices.
[ 00:10:41.980 -->  00:10:44.460] [SPEAKER_05] Like with Christina and I, we gave him the choice,
[ 00:10:44.460 -->  00:10:47.140] [SPEAKER_05] do you want to work with Miss Christina or with me?
[ 00:10:47.140 -->  00:10:48.580] [SPEAKER_05] And he chose Christina.
[ 00:10:49.740 -->  00:10:52.380] [SPEAKER_05] And you know, it's hard to hear, but.
[ 00:10:52.380 -->  00:10:54.340] [SPEAKER_04] But it was also like, he played it really well,
[ 00:10:54.340 -->  00:10:55.860] [SPEAKER_07] because you were like, oh my God, really?
[ 00:10:55.860 -->  00:10:56.820] [SPEAKER_07] Like you don't want to talk to me?
[ 00:10:56.820 -->  00:10:59.460] [SPEAKER_07] He was like, and she was like, no, it's okay, I know.
[ 00:10:59.480 -->  00:11:00.760] [SPEAKER_07] I know we're still friends, right?
[ 00:11:00.760 -->  00:11:01.600] [SPEAKER_07] And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ 00:11:01.600 -->  00:11:03.680] [SPEAKER_07] It was a good bonding moment.
[ 00:11:03.680 -->  00:11:05.720] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, yeah, it was a good bonding moment,
[ 00:11:05.720 -->  00:11:08.400] [SPEAKER_05] and then he was shaking hands with me.
[ 00:11:08.400 -->  00:11:10.520] [SPEAKER_05] It's fine, it's not that he doesn't,
[ 00:11:10.520 -->  00:11:13.840] [SPEAKER_05] like he's making decisions and being a person, right?
[ 00:11:13.840 -->  00:11:16.280] [SPEAKER_05] In that process, and trying it out
[ 00:11:16.280 -->  00:11:17.960] [SPEAKER_05] and seeing how this works.
[ 00:11:17.960 -->  00:11:20.400] [SPEAKER_05] You know, if you choose to go to another center.
[ 00:11:20.400 -->  00:11:22.640] [SPEAKER_05] We did have, in the past, we had some time
[ 00:11:22.640 -->  00:11:24.960] [SPEAKER_05] for children to choose to go to other centers.
[ 00:11:24.960 -->  00:11:25.800] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah.
[ 00:11:25.800 -->  00:11:30.800] [SPEAKER_05] So, you know, we were totally out of our space to do that.
[ 00:11:30.820 -->  00:11:33.020] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, it was no problem.
[ 00:11:33.020 -->  00:11:34.300] [SPEAKER_02] It should have worked out.
[ 00:11:34.300 -->  00:11:36.060] [SPEAKER_05] So you just, I mean, right?
[ 00:11:36.060 -->  00:11:37.380] [SPEAKER_05] You just allowed him, that's how you.
[ 00:11:37.380 -->  00:11:38.740] [SPEAKER_02] Well, yeah, kind of.
[ 00:11:38.740 -->  00:11:41.860] [SPEAKER_02] He didn't come back, and then we heard he was there.
[ 00:11:43.020 -->  00:11:46.020] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, I was like, oh, I guess he left somewhere.
[ 00:11:46.020 -->  00:11:48.320] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, we knew he was accounted for somewhere.
[ 00:11:49.940 -->  00:11:51.860] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that worries me a little bit.
[ 00:11:51.860 -->  00:11:53.620] [SPEAKER_05] Like at one point, he left the room too,
[ 00:11:53.640 -->  00:11:56.920] [SPEAKER_05] which I followed him, because what worries me,
[ 00:11:56.920 -->  00:11:59.920] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, I don't know how often he might disappear.
[ 00:11:59.920 -->  00:12:02.000] [SPEAKER_03] He does it quite often, but he did ask.
[ 00:12:02.000 -->  00:12:05.360] [SPEAKER_03] He asked somebody, I forget who he asked, to get water.
[ 00:12:05.360 -->  00:12:06.200] [SPEAKER_00] And I had a conversation with him,
[ 00:12:06.200 -->  00:12:08.800] [SPEAKER_03] because he recently started sitting on the bathroom floor
[ 00:12:08.800 -->  00:12:10.880] [SPEAKER_03] and just zoning out.
[ 00:12:10.880 -->  00:12:12.440] [SPEAKER_03] And so we had a conversation,
[ 00:12:12.440 -->  00:12:15.180] [SPEAKER_03] make sure you go to the water, come back,
[ 00:12:15.180 -->  00:12:17.240] [SPEAKER_03] don't go to the bathroom, don't go to the floor,
[ 00:12:17.240 -->  00:12:18.600] [SPEAKER_03] just come straight back.
[ 00:12:18.600 -->  00:12:19.440] [SPEAKER_03] And that's when he saw you.
[ 00:12:19.440 -->  00:12:22.120] [SPEAKER_03] I saw him see you, and I saw him see you.
[ 00:12:22.140 -->  00:12:25.220] [SPEAKER_03] I saw you direct him, or not, like talk to him,
[ 00:12:25.220 -->  00:12:26.060] [SPEAKER_03] and you went into the other room,
[ 00:12:26.060 -->  00:12:27.620] [SPEAKER_03] and he was like, okay, he's fine.
[ 00:12:27.620 -->  00:12:28.460] [SPEAKER_04] But I didn't know what was happening.
[ 00:12:28.460 -->  00:12:30.420] [SPEAKER_05] Don't leave the room by yourself,
[ 00:12:30.420 -->  00:12:32.900] [SPEAKER_05] because we get scared, we don't know where you are.
[ 00:12:32.900 -->  00:12:35.620] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, he was supposed to go with somebody?
[ 00:12:35.620 -->  00:12:36.940] [SPEAKER_05] He was in our class.
[ 00:12:36.940 -->  00:12:38.420] [SPEAKER_05] He was supposed to get water.
[ 00:12:39.420 -->  00:12:42.340] [SPEAKER_05] He was coming from there, but he hadn't asked.
[ 00:12:42.340 -->  00:12:43.180] [SPEAKER_05] No, he asked.
[ 00:12:43.180 -->  00:12:44.020] [SPEAKER_02] He asked one of us.
[ 00:12:44.020 -->  00:12:44.840] [SPEAKER_05] He asked.
[ 00:12:44.840 -->  00:12:45.680] [SPEAKER_05] He asked us.
[ 00:12:45.680 -->  00:12:46.520] [SPEAKER_05] He came here?
[ 00:12:46.520 -->  00:12:47.360] [SPEAKER_05] He was in our group.
[ 00:12:47.360 -->  00:12:49.420] [SPEAKER_02] He was in my group, originally.
[ 00:12:49.420 -->  00:12:51.660] [SPEAKER_05] No, but this was when he was with us,
[ 00:12:52.200 -->  00:12:53.040] [SPEAKER_05] and then he left again.
[ 00:12:53.040 -->  00:12:53.880] [SPEAKER_05] Oh.
[ 00:12:53.880 -->  00:12:54.700] [SPEAKER_05] He left again.
[ 00:12:54.700 -->  00:12:56.160] [SPEAKER_05] And I don't think he has permission in that.
[ 00:12:56.160 -->  00:12:57.000] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, he doesn't.
[ 00:12:57.000 -->  00:12:59.120] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, because he was in my group, right, Christina?
[ 00:12:59.120 -->  00:12:59.960] [SPEAKER_05] I don't know.
[ 00:12:59.960 -->  00:13:00.800] [SPEAKER_05] At some point, I went out, followed him.
[ 00:13:00.800 -->  00:13:02.160] [SPEAKER_07] He was talking to me.
[ 00:13:02.160 -->  00:13:03.520] [SPEAKER_07] He was talking to me the whole time in our group,
[ 00:13:03.520 -->  00:13:04.600] [SPEAKER_07] so I don't think it was in our group.
[ 00:13:04.600 -->  00:13:05.440] [SPEAKER_05] Maybe not.
[ 00:13:05.440 -->  00:13:06.280] [SPEAKER_05] He doesn't leave.
[ 00:13:06.280 -->  00:13:07.840] [SPEAKER_05] At some point, I followed him.
[ 00:13:07.840 -->  00:13:08.760] [SPEAKER_05] I have talked to him.
[ 00:13:08.760 -->  00:13:09.600] [SPEAKER_05] He doesn't go far.
[ 00:13:09.600 -->  00:13:10.720] [SPEAKER_05] Maybe he could ask for permission,
[ 00:13:10.720 -->  00:13:13.040] [SPEAKER_05] but I followed him at some point, because he left.
[ 00:13:13.040 -->  00:13:15.800] [SPEAKER_09] Maybe at the beginning, because we were playing.
[ 00:13:15.800 -->  00:13:17.000] [SPEAKER_09] Too recent.
[ 00:13:17.000 -->  00:13:17.840] [SPEAKER_03] Maybe he walks away in the snack.
[ 00:13:17.840 -->  00:13:18.680] [SPEAKER_03] He walks away because he zones out,
[ 00:13:18.680 -->  00:13:19.520] [SPEAKER_03] and he just walks away.
[ 00:13:19.540 -->  00:13:21.220] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, maybe my ideas are, you know.
[ 00:13:21.220 -->  00:13:22.060] [SPEAKER_03] But he doesn't go far.
[ 00:13:22.060 -->  00:13:22.880] [SPEAKER_03] Maybe it was in our group.
[ 00:13:22.880 -->  00:13:23.720] [SPEAKER_03] A lot happened.
[ 00:13:23.720 -->  00:13:24.540] [SPEAKER_09] He goes to the bathroom a lot.
[ 00:13:24.540 -->  00:13:25.380] [SPEAKER_09] I understand him.
[ 00:13:25.380 -->  00:13:26.780] [SPEAKER_09] I do the same.
[ 00:13:26.780 -->  00:13:29.060] [SPEAKER_09] Sometimes my husband is talking to me,
[ 00:13:29.060 -->  00:13:30.740] [SPEAKER_05] and I'm not listening.
[ 00:13:30.740 -->  00:13:31.580] [SPEAKER_05] This happens.
[ 00:13:31.580 -->  00:13:32.420] [SPEAKER_05] He always complains.
[ 00:13:32.420 -->  00:13:33.240] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:13:33.240 -->  00:13:34.080] [SPEAKER_05] We have in my son's class,
[ 00:13:34.080 -->  00:13:36.420] [SPEAKER_05] there's a boy that also leaves the classroom
[ 00:13:36.420 -->  00:13:39.460] [SPEAKER_05] for the bathroom, and he disappears for two hours,
[ 00:13:39.460 -->  00:13:42.100] [SPEAKER_05] and the teacher gets very worried.
[ 00:13:42.100 -->  00:13:42.980] [SPEAKER_05] He needs a break.
[ 00:13:42.980 -->  00:13:44.780] [SPEAKER_05] He has also a very complicated life.
[ 00:13:44.780 -->  00:13:45.620] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:13:45.620 -->  00:13:47.620] [SPEAKER_05] But you know, we need.
[ 00:13:47.640 -->  00:13:49.360] [SPEAKER_09] We have talked about this before,
[ 00:13:49.360 -->  00:13:52.520] [SPEAKER_09] that at least on my impression,
[ 00:13:52.520 -->  00:13:57.000] [SPEAKER_09] is that he's still adjusting to have a routine,
[ 00:13:57.000 -->  00:14:02.000] [SPEAKER_09] and to learn the rules,
[ 00:14:02.000 -->  00:14:03.680] [SPEAKER_09] and the procedures,
[ 00:14:03.680 -->  00:14:06.840] [SPEAKER_09] and what is supposed to be done.
[ 00:14:06.840 -->  00:14:10.640] [SPEAKER_09] So I think that sometimes he is on that mood.
[ 00:14:10.640 -->  00:14:15.040] [SPEAKER_09] Like most kids, ask permission, follow the instruction.
[ 00:14:15.060 -->  00:14:16.900] [SPEAKER_09] But sometimes he just.
[ 00:14:18.180 -->  00:14:21.980] [SPEAKER_05] I guess, I still don't know how much we can trust him.
[ 00:14:21.980 -->  00:14:22.820] [SPEAKER_05] This is the issue.
[ 00:14:22.820 -->  00:14:26.500] [SPEAKER_05] I would be happy if he goes by himself to the bathroom.
[ 00:14:26.500 -->  00:14:29.060] [SPEAKER_05] But I also feel a little responsible.
[ 00:14:30.540 -->  00:14:33.660] [SPEAKER_05] But if we think that we can trust him,
[ 00:14:33.660 -->  00:14:34.500] [SPEAKER_05] yeah, totally fine.
[ 00:14:34.500 -->  00:14:37.460] [SPEAKER_05] Especially if he had asked for permission.
[ 00:14:37.460 -->  00:14:40.780] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, he's gotten better at asking.
[ 00:14:40.780 -->  00:14:43.460] [SPEAKER_03] Now he'll just ask to go one place,
[ 00:14:43.680 -->  00:14:45.440] [SPEAKER_03] and go another place too.
[ 00:14:45.440 -->  00:14:47.440] [SPEAKER_03] So we just kind of give him a break.
[ 00:14:49.360 -->  00:14:50.960] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, he can go back very quickly.
[ 00:14:50.960 -->  00:14:51.800] [SPEAKER_05] He will be fine.
[ 00:14:51.800 -->  00:14:52.640] [SPEAKER_05] It was not today.
[ 00:14:52.640 -->  00:14:54.920] [SPEAKER_05] He was actually very responsive,
[ 00:14:54.920 -->  00:14:56.280] [SPEAKER_05] he wouldn't say it, no.
[ 00:14:56.280 -->  00:14:57.960] [SPEAKER_08] Did you think that way, Steven?
[ 00:14:57.960 -->  00:15:01.520] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, I mean, I'm just seeing progress this semester,
[ 00:15:01.520 -->  00:15:03.080] [SPEAKER_08] because I feel like he's more of one,
[ 00:15:03.080 -->  00:15:05.280] [SPEAKER_08] not running away.
[ 00:15:05.280 -->  00:15:07.880] [SPEAKER_08] Running is very different than walking around.
[ 00:15:07.880 -->  00:15:09.080] [SPEAKER_08] He also has permission today
[ 00:15:09.080 -->  00:15:11.200] [SPEAKER_08] to go scare the teacher next door.
[ 00:15:11.200 -->  00:15:12.040] [SPEAKER_03] Oh yeah, he does.
[ 00:15:12.060 -->  00:15:13.940] [SPEAKER_08] How many times are you scaring someone?
[ 00:15:13.940 -->  00:15:16.580] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, and he asked for permission to do that.
[ 00:15:16.580 -->  00:15:17.420] [SPEAKER_08] You know what I mean?
[ 00:15:17.420 -->  00:15:19.140] [SPEAKER_08] It's like, how hilarious.
[ 00:15:19.140 -->  00:15:20.940] [SPEAKER_08] But can I go scare my teacher?
[ 00:15:22.260 -->  00:15:24.860] [SPEAKER_07] I do, I feel like I've seen progress with him.
[ 00:15:24.860 -->  00:15:25.700] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah.
[ 00:15:25.700 -->  00:15:26.620] [SPEAKER_07] Like I've seen, he's,
[ 00:15:27.580 -->  00:15:28.420] [SPEAKER_07] and I think you're right.
[ 00:15:28.420 -->  00:15:31.500] [SPEAKER_07] Like I think that, I mean, I don't know.
[ 00:15:31.500 -->  00:15:33.620] [SPEAKER_07] I can't, I feel like I can't be the one to be like,
[ 00:15:33.620 -->  00:15:34.460] [SPEAKER_07] oh, it's Trump.
[ 00:15:34.460 -->  00:15:36.460] [SPEAKER_07] But like, I think it seems like there's
[ 00:15:36.460 -->  00:15:38.620] [SPEAKER_07] just like a lot going on in that kid's head,
[ 00:15:38.620 -->  00:15:41.180] [SPEAKER_07] and that he doesn't know what to do with, probably.
[ 00:15:43.020 -->  00:15:45.980] [SPEAKER_07] But I feel like I've seen him kind of like,
[ 00:15:45.980 -->  00:15:47.180] [SPEAKER_07] become a little bit more stable,
[ 00:15:47.180 -->  00:15:50.860] [SPEAKER_07] or like a little bit more, I don't know.
[ 00:15:50.860 -->  00:15:53.820] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah, he's like, he doesn't fight me as much,
[ 00:15:53.820 -->  00:15:55.620] [SPEAKER_07] fight us as much on things, I think.
[ 00:15:57.780 -->  00:15:58.860] [SPEAKER_07] Which has been good.
[ 00:15:58.860 -->  00:16:03.860] [SPEAKER_06] When we walk down, he doesn't run away, or,
[ 00:16:03.900 -->  00:16:08.060] [SPEAKER_06] yeah, because the first week, he's gonna run.
[ 00:16:08.060 -->  00:16:08.900] [SPEAKER_06] Right.
[ 00:16:08.900 -->  00:16:09.740] [SPEAKER_06] Yeah.
[ 00:16:09.740 -->  00:16:10.560] [SPEAKER_03] We're gonna go use hands.
[ 00:16:10.560 -->  00:16:13.060] [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, then I was holding his hand to go down,
[ 00:16:13.060 -->  00:16:14.780] [SPEAKER_06] now he's just walking next to me.
[ 00:16:14.780 -->  00:16:17.420] [SPEAKER_08] He plays, he knows that there's gonna be a play downstairs.
[ 00:16:17.420 -->  00:16:18.260] [SPEAKER_08] Yes.
[ 00:16:18.260 -->  00:16:19.860] [SPEAKER_08] He comes here, and then he's playing around,
[ 00:16:19.860 -->  00:16:23.220] [SPEAKER_08] guesses the village, whatever that was, the shop,
[ 00:16:23.220 -->  00:16:27.580] [SPEAKER_08] and then, guess what my pizza, what food I have in my, yeah.
[ 00:16:27.580 -->  00:16:28.980] [SPEAKER_05] That, the pizza looks so bad.
[ 00:16:28.980 -->  00:16:30.500] [SPEAKER_05] He's like, should I throw it away?
[ 00:16:30.500 -->  00:16:32.060] [SPEAKER_05] I'm like, well, it seems cold.
[ 00:16:33.340 -->  00:16:36.340] [SPEAKER_05] He took another bite, and, well, just throw it away.
[ 00:16:36.340 -->  00:16:39.500] [SPEAKER_08] But he walks around and asks almost everybody.
[ 00:16:39.520 -->  00:16:40.360] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, yeah.
[ 00:16:40.360 -->  00:16:41.400] [SPEAKER_08] What do you think is in my pizza?
[ 00:16:41.400 -->  00:16:42.240] [SPEAKER_08] Like, what is it?
[ 00:16:42.240 -->  00:16:43.060] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:16:43.060 -->  00:16:43.900] [SPEAKER_02] Pizza de queso.
[ 00:16:43.900 -->  00:16:44.880] [SPEAKER_02] So we're connecting.
[ 00:16:44.880 -->  00:16:46.200] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, Darielle came up to me,
[ 00:16:46.200 -->  00:16:47.800] [SPEAKER_02] and I was like, it's cheese pizza.
[ 00:16:47.800 -->  00:16:48.640] [SPEAKER_02] Yes, okay.
[ 00:16:48.640 -->  00:16:50.000] [SPEAKER_04] I was like, okay.
[ 00:16:50.000 -->  00:16:54.640] [SPEAKER_04] So let's talk about today's learning session,
[ 00:16:54.640 -->  00:16:57.880] [SPEAKER_04] and let's start with a star today.
[ 00:16:57.880 -->  00:16:59.840] [SPEAKER_04] May I, at some point, you have to tell about your,
[ 00:16:59.840 -->  00:17:01.480] [SPEAKER_05] the story of your tattoos.
[ 00:17:01.480 -->  00:17:02.880] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, I did tell you.
[ 00:17:02.880 -->  00:17:04.720] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I was so happy.
[ 00:17:04.720 -->  00:17:07.760] [SPEAKER_02] I didn't mean to make that a focus of today's lesson.
[ 00:17:07.760 -->  00:17:09.440] [SPEAKER_05] Well, they vary, you know, because you're wearing
[ 00:17:10.380 -->  00:17:11.220] [SPEAKER_04] the same thing.
[ 00:17:11.220 -->  00:17:12.040] [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, it was too hot.
[ 00:17:12.040 -->  00:17:12.880] [SPEAKER_04] No, that's fine.
[ 00:17:12.880 -->  00:17:13.720] [SPEAKER_04] You can wear those things, right?
[ 00:17:13.720 -->  00:17:15.860] [SPEAKER_04] That's a very good moment.
[ 00:17:15.860 -->  00:17:16.700] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah.
[ 00:17:16.700 -->  00:17:17.520] [SPEAKER_08] It was just so funny.
[ 00:17:17.520 -->  00:17:19.100] [SPEAKER_08] Like, I think it's a really good thing.
[ 00:17:19.100 -->  00:17:20.200] [SPEAKER_02] We're all having fun.
[ 00:17:21.180 -->  00:17:23.140] [SPEAKER_02] They're film rolls.
[ 00:17:23.140 -->  00:17:25.260] [None] It's medium format film.
[ 00:17:25.260 -->  00:17:28.100] [SPEAKER_02] So this one's a full roll, and this one's an empty roll.
[ 00:17:28.100 -->  00:17:28.940] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, so it's connected.
[ 00:17:28.940 -->  00:17:29.780] [SPEAKER_05] I do think it's connected.
[ 00:17:29.780 -->  00:17:30.620] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:17:30.620 -->  00:17:31.500] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, it is connected.
[ 00:17:31.500 -->  00:17:32.860] [SPEAKER_02] I guess I could have told it.
[ 00:17:32.860 -->  00:17:34.700] [SPEAKER_05] Yes, it's actually a good connection
[ 00:17:34.700 -->  00:17:36.660] [SPEAKER_05] that they realize it's so important for you,
[ 00:17:36.660 -->  00:17:37.980] [SPEAKER_05] and you're sharing this with them.
[ 00:17:37.980 -->  00:17:40.520] [SPEAKER_02] Maybe I'll bring it up in front of them.
[ 00:17:40.520 -->  00:17:42.880] [SPEAKER_02] I genuinely thought they were like cans or something.
[ 00:17:42.880 -->  00:17:45.840] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, no, everyone thinks they're something else.
[ 00:17:45.840 -->  00:17:47.160] [SPEAKER_02] Campbell chicken soup or something.
[ 00:17:47.160 -->  00:17:48.000] [SPEAKER_02] Campbell chicken soup.
[ 00:17:48.000 -->  00:17:49.880] [SPEAKER_02] People thought, one time,
[ 00:17:49.880 -->  00:17:52.300] [SPEAKER_02] Oh, no, that's a new thing.
[ 00:17:52.300 -->  00:17:54.920] [SPEAKER_02] A cop thought I was military.
[ 00:17:54.920 -->  00:17:56.760] [SPEAKER_02] He thought this was one, this was a one.
[ 00:17:56.760 -->  00:17:58.720] [SPEAKER_02] I was like, no.
[ 00:17:58.720 -->  00:18:00.240] [SPEAKER_02] If anything, it looks like a two,
[ 00:18:00.240 -->  00:18:01.080] [SPEAKER_07] because it's both.
[ 00:18:01.080 -->  00:18:02.200] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah.
[ 00:18:02.200 -->  00:18:03.520] [SPEAKER_07] Like in Roman numerals, a two.
[ 00:18:03.520 -->  00:18:05.280] [SPEAKER_07] It's just very ancient.
[ 00:18:05.280 -->  00:18:06.680] [None] Like nowadays, we don't see these.
[ 00:18:06.680 -->  00:18:07.520] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, we don't see those.
[ 00:18:08.020 -->  00:18:11.020] [SPEAKER_02] I'm part of the first battalion of Roman legions.
[ 00:18:11.020 -->  00:18:16.020] [SPEAKER_09] Well, you can ask them to guess what they are.
[ 00:18:16.820 -->  00:18:17.660] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:18:17.660 -->  00:18:18.500] [SPEAKER_09] And tell them.
[ 00:18:18.500 -->  00:18:21.260] [SPEAKER_09] What do you think, and if they're connected.
[ 00:18:21.260 -->  00:18:22.100] [SPEAKER_05] I could tell them.
[ 00:18:22.100 -->  00:18:24.540] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that would be a good guess and find out.
[ 00:18:24.540 -->  00:18:29.180] [SPEAKER_05] So, Joe, I want to hear about your group
[ 00:18:29.180 -->  00:18:30.340] [SPEAKER_05] and the learning that you saw.
[ 00:18:30.340 -->  00:18:33.420] [SPEAKER_05] Should we look at the movie first or after?
[ 00:18:33.420 -->  00:18:34.700] [SPEAKER_02] I'll talk about it first, and then we can.
[ 00:18:34.700 -->  00:18:35.540] [SPEAKER_02] Okay, okay.
[ 00:18:35.540 -->  00:18:36.500] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:18:36.520 -->  00:18:38.840] [SPEAKER_02] So, I want to hear what you guys think
[ 00:18:38.840 -->  00:18:41.320] [SPEAKER_02] of how the up here with the whole group went.
[ 00:18:41.320 -->  00:18:42.240] [None] I thought it went pretty well.
[ 00:18:42.240 -->  00:18:45.380] [SPEAKER_02] But in the small group who were there,
[ 00:18:46.800 -->  00:18:48.700] [SPEAKER_02] the hardest part was definitely getting them
[ 00:18:48.700 -->  00:18:53.700] [SPEAKER_02] to agree on different things that they were proposing.
[ 00:18:54.060 -->  00:18:56.900] [None] But once they had, like once I was like,
[ 00:18:56.900 -->  00:19:00.080] [SPEAKER_02] okay, you've suggested a dog, you've suggested a cat.
[ 00:19:00.080 -->  00:19:02.200] [SPEAKER_02] Let's do a dog and a cat.
[ 00:19:02.200 -->  00:19:05.160] [SPEAKER_02] They started to be like, oh, and they could have a treat.
[ 00:19:05.180 -->  00:19:06.740] [SPEAKER_02] And like the cat gets a treat.
[ 00:19:06.740 -->  00:19:10.740] [SPEAKER_02] And then Kaylee suggested maybe they're fighting
[ 00:19:10.740 -->  00:19:13.420] [SPEAKER_02] over a treat and they have to share it.
[ 00:19:13.420 -->  00:19:16.080] [SPEAKER_02] And then someone else was like, no, no, no.
[ 00:19:16.080 -->  00:19:17.880] [SPEAKER_02] They each get a treat of their own.
[ 00:19:17.880 -->  00:19:21.020] [SPEAKER_02] And then I started to move on.
[ 00:19:21.020 -->  00:19:23.320] [SPEAKER_02] Like, okay, we know the stories about a dog and a cat.
[ 00:19:23.320 -->  00:19:24.580] [SPEAKER_02] Where is this taking place?
[ 00:19:24.580 -->  00:19:26.940] [SPEAKER_02] Then they were like, it's at a park.
[ 00:19:26.940 -->  00:19:30.060] [SPEAKER_02] And then they were like, okay, so the dog goes
[ 00:19:30.060 -->  00:19:32.060] [SPEAKER_02] across the slide, or down the slide.
[ 00:19:32.060 -->  00:19:34.380] [SPEAKER_02] And they have the monkey bars.
[ 00:19:34.400 -->  00:19:35.840] [SPEAKER_02] It came together as we went.
[ 00:19:35.840 -->  00:19:39.400] [SPEAKER_02] But Israel was upset that we didn't put a,
[ 00:19:39.400 -->  00:19:42.280] [SPEAKER_02] at first he was upset that we didn't put a human character
[ 00:19:42.280 -->  00:19:43.920] [SPEAKER_02] and he wanted a human character.
[ 00:19:43.920 -->  00:19:47.280] [SPEAKER_02] But then, and he was, he's the one that made the dog.
[ 00:19:47.280 -->  00:19:51.560] [SPEAKER_02] And he kept saying it's really ugly, stuff like that.
[ 00:19:51.560 -->  00:19:52.400] [SPEAKER_02] He's right.
[ 00:19:52.400 -->  00:19:55.640] [SPEAKER_09] Oh, that's why he wanted to draw a dog.
[ 00:19:55.640 -->  00:19:57.760] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so did you practice it with him later?
[ 00:19:57.760 -->  00:19:59.360] [SPEAKER_09] Oh, we talked about it.
[ 00:19:59.360 -->  00:20:04.360] [SPEAKER_09] So he saw me that I was drawing a dog for Kelsey.
[ 00:20:04.880 -->  00:20:09.120] [SPEAKER_09] And he was really mad that I was able to draw
[ 00:20:09.120 -->  00:20:10.760] [SPEAKER_09] with Kelsey, not with him.
[ 00:20:10.760 -->  00:20:14.680] [SPEAKER_09] I said, okay, let's sit down and I'll show you how I did it.
[ 00:20:14.680 -->  00:20:18.680] [SPEAKER_09] So we sat down and I explained that it's not that I made it,
[ 00:20:18.680 -->  00:20:20.440] [SPEAKER_09] I just copied it.
[ 00:20:20.440 -->  00:20:24.520] [SPEAKER_09] So we talk about copying things, like inspiring us.
[ 00:20:24.520 -->  00:20:28.000] [SPEAKER_09] So we have the, and we did, because I did it with Kelsey,
[ 00:20:28.000 -->  00:20:30.200] [SPEAKER_09] we did half and half.
[ 00:20:30.200 -->  00:20:33.080] [SPEAKER_09] I did the main form of the dog.
[ 00:20:33.140 -->  00:20:35.100] [SPEAKER_09] And then made all the little details.
[ 00:20:35.100 -->  00:20:36.060] [SPEAKER_02] The features.
[ 00:20:36.060 -->  00:20:36.900] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:20:36.900 -->  00:20:39.180] [SPEAKER_02] Did you look up something online and copy from that?
[ 00:20:39.180 -->  00:20:40.300] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ 00:20:40.300 -->  00:20:45.300] [SPEAKER_09] We had a picture of a dog I put there and I just did.
[ 00:20:45.340 -->  00:20:47.580] [SPEAKER_09] And then we did a little spelling,
[ 00:20:47.580 -->  00:20:50.180] [SPEAKER_09] because he wanted to write my name and his name
[ 00:20:50.180 -->  00:20:51.300] [SPEAKER_09] as the authors.
[ 00:20:52.260 -->  00:20:53.980] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so after we finished,
[ 00:20:53.980 -->  00:20:56.900] [SPEAKER_02] because I was kind of trying to rush to the next animation,
[ 00:20:56.900 -->  00:20:58.140] [SPEAKER_02] we didn't end up having time for it.
[ 00:20:58.140 -->  00:21:01.500] [None] But at the end, he kept, he was trying to draw another dog
[ 00:21:01.880 -->  00:21:03.520] [None] and was saying it's ugly.
[ 00:21:03.520 -->  00:21:05.640] [None] And I was like, I don't think, I kept telling him,
[ 00:21:05.640 -->  00:21:08.400] [None] we just need to practice, I don't think it's ugly.
[ 00:21:08.400 -->  00:21:11.440] [None] Like the first dog I drew I thought was ugly too.
[ 00:21:11.440 -->  00:21:13.240] [SPEAKER_02] I asked him, do you want me to draw a dog?
[ 00:21:13.240 -->  00:21:15.240] [SPEAKER_02] And I drew one very quickly.
[ 00:21:15.240 -->  00:21:16.880] [SPEAKER_02] And he was like, oh, it looks great.
[ 00:21:16.880 -->  00:21:20.640] [SPEAKER_02] And I was like, well, the first one I drew wasn't great.
[ 00:21:21.720 -->  00:21:24.320] [SPEAKER_02] But that still prompted him to start drawing more.
[ 00:21:24.320 -->  00:21:26.160] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah, I told him the same.
[ 00:21:26.160 -->  00:21:27.320] [SPEAKER_09] He just kept practicing.
[ 00:21:27.320 -->  00:21:29.480] [SPEAKER_09] I don't know how to draw dogs.
[ 00:21:29.500 -->  00:21:31.740] [SPEAKER_09] I just know how to copy them.
[ 00:21:31.740 -->  00:21:34.580] [SPEAKER_09] Without the image, I wouldn't be able to do that.
[ 00:21:34.580 -->  00:21:37.060] [SPEAKER_02] After I drew my little sketch, he copied that one
[ 00:21:37.060 -->  00:21:38.860] [SPEAKER_02] and then he did another one of his own.
[ 00:21:38.860 -->  00:21:41.060] [SPEAKER_02] But I think from the beginning to the end,
[ 00:21:41.060 -->  00:21:44.500] [SPEAKER_02] he understood at least that he had gotten better,
[ 00:21:44.500 -->  00:21:47.020] [SPEAKER_02] whether or not he still thought his dogs were ugly.
[ 00:21:48.860 -->  00:21:50.980] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that's the artistic part, right?
[ 00:21:51.900 -->  00:21:56.220] [SPEAKER_05] Trying to imagine how a dog looks like and trying to,
[ 00:21:56.220 -->  00:21:57.700] [SPEAKER_05] like that's artistic process.
[ 00:21:57.720 -->  00:22:01.320] [SPEAKER_05] I don't want to take away, right, you're not the patient.
[ 00:22:01.320 -->  00:22:04.000] [SPEAKER_02] Right, you don't want to guide them too much.
[ 00:22:04.000 -->  00:22:06.240] [SPEAKER_02] But I was asking him questions like,
[ 00:22:06.240 -->  00:22:07.480] [None] what do a dog's ears look like?
[ 00:22:07.480 -->  00:22:09.680] [SPEAKER_02] Are they pointy or are they flopping down?
[ 00:22:09.680 -->  00:22:14.680] [SPEAKER_02] And he was like, I'm thinking of something to think about.
[ 00:22:14.880 -->  00:22:17.480] [SPEAKER_02] But as you can see, his dog doesn't have ears.
[ 00:22:18.840 -->  00:22:20.760] [SPEAKER_09] We talk about the shapes.
[ 00:22:22.440 -->  00:22:24.120] [SPEAKER_09] Because he was worried of doing it.
[ 00:22:24.120 -->  00:22:27.280] [SPEAKER_09] So what I did, we talk about the shapes
[ 00:22:27.860 -->  00:22:30.020] [SPEAKER_09] that he could see on the drawing.
[ 00:22:30.020 -->  00:22:34.780] [SPEAKER_09] So now he's like, oh, okay, this is a circle.
[ 00:22:34.780 -->  00:22:36.820] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah, so we start with a circle.
[ 00:22:36.820 -->  00:22:39.220] [SPEAKER_09] And the ears look like what?
[ 00:22:39.220 -->  00:22:41.300] [SPEAKER_09] Say they look like hot dog bread.
[ 00:22:42.260 -->  00:22:44.500] [SPEAKER_09] They're completely round, they're hot dog.
[ 00:22:44.500 -->  00:22:45.340] [SPEAKER_09] Oh, yeah.
[ 00:22:45.340 -->  00:22:46.860] [SPEAKER_05] This is from the one they were looking at.
[ 00:22:46.860 -->  00:22:47.700] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah, the internet.
[ 00:22:47.700 -->  00:22:50.060] [SPEAKER_09] But I'm giving those names to the shapes.
[ 00:22:50.060 -->  00:22:51.140] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah, I get it.
[ 00:22:51.140 -->  00:22:53.180] [SPEAKER_05] Those are the shapes.
[ 00:22:53.180 -->  00:22:55.180] [SPEAKER_05] The survival strategy.
[ 00:22:55.180 -->  00:22:57.220] [SPEAKER_07] I do feel like, I get it.
[ 00:22:58.160 -->  00:23:00.200] [SPEAKER_07] When I was a kid, I would get so frustrated
[ 00:23:00.200 -->  00:23:02.440] [SPEAKER_07] when my drawings didn't look the way
[ 00:23:02.440 -->  00:23:04.520] [SPEAKER_07] that I thought they would in my head.
[ 00:23:04.520 -->  00:23:07.480] [SPEAKER_07] So just like, it's hard.
[ 00:23:07.480 -->  00:23:08.320] [SPEAKER_07] That's all.
[ 00:23:08.320 -->  00:23:10.280] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, and so Kelsey was there.
[ 00:23:10.280 -->  00:23:11.360] [SPEAKER_02] She drew the cat.
[ 00:23:12.880 -->  00:23:15.280] [SPEAKER_02] And he was comparing, Israel was comparing
[ 00:23:15.280 -->  00:23:16.800] [SPEAKER_02] his dog to her cat.
[ 00:23:17.840 -->  00:23:19.560] [SPEAKER_02] I was saying, well, she's practiced
[ 00:23:19.560 -->  00:23:20.800] [SPEAKER_02] drawing a cat a lot then.
[ 00:23:21.760 -->  00:23:24.480] [SPEAKER_02] And she was saying that Kaylee's perfect.
[ 00:23:24.480 -->  00:23:25.600] [None] Kaylee's perfect at everything.
[ 00:23:25.620 -->  00:23:27.420] [SPEAKER_02] Her teacher thinks she's perfect.
[ 00:23:27.420 -->  00:23:30.020] [SPEAKER_02] And Kaylee was like, no, what are you talking about?
[ 00:23:30.020 -->  00:23:30.980] [SPEAKER_02] I'm not perfect.
[ 00:23:30.980 -->  00:23:32.220] [SPEAKER_02] I was like, no one is.
[ 00:23:32.220 -->  00:23:33.580] [SPEAKER_05] Who said that, Israel?
[ 00:23:33.580 -->  00:23:38.540] [SPEAKER_02] No, Kelsey was saying that Kaylee is perfect at everything.
[ 00:23:38.540 -->  00:23:41.140] [SPEAKER_02] And I was like, no one's perfect at everything.
[ 00:23:41.140 -->  00:23:43.340] [SPEAKER_02] We had a small conversation about,
[ 00:23:44.460 -->  00:23:45.500] [SPEAKER_02] practicing makes you better,
[ 00:23:45.500 -->  00:23:48.020] [SPEAKER_02] but nobody's ever perfect at anything.
[ 00:23:49.620 -->  00:23:50.580] [None] But you wanna watch it?
[ 00:23:50.580 -->  00:23:51.420] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:23:51.420 -->  00:23:52.240] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I'm a big dog.
[ 00:23:52.240 -->  00:23:53.340] [SPEAKER_02] It's five seconds long.
[ 00:23:55.860 -->  00:23:56.700] [None] Oh!
[ 00:23:57.900 -->  00:23:59.940] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so they also wanted to throw the treats
[ 00:23:59.940 -->  00:24:02.940] [SPEAKER_02] in the garbage at the end, rather than having to eat them.
[ 00:24:02.940 -->  00:24:04.740] [SPEAKER_05] Again, then I'll.
[ 00:24:04.740 -->  00:24:05.580] [SPEAKER_05] Wow.
[ 00:24:07.180 -->  00:24:10.740] [SPEAKER_02] So they go over the monkey bars, over the slide.
[ 00:24:11.660 -->  00:24:13.780] [SPEAKER_05] Aw, that's so cute.
[ 00:24:13.780 -->  00:24:14.620] [SPEAKER_05] Beautiful.
[ 00:24:14.620 -->  00:24:16.700] [SPEAKER_05] And I don't think that dog is ugly.
[ 00:24:16.700 -->  00:24:17.820] [SPEAKER_02] I don't think so either.
[ 00:24:17.820 -->  00:24:20.220] [SPEAKER_02] I think it's clear that it's a dog.
[ 00:24:20.220 -->  00:24:22.020] [SPEAKER_05] And it's a person's sketch, right?
[ 00:24:22.020 -->  00:24:23.500] [SPEAKER_05] And if he doesn't draw,
[ 00:24:23.520 -->  00:24:26.000] [SPEAKER_05] just from his mind, start drawing,
[ 00:24:26.000 -->  00:24:29.440] [SPEAKER_05] then he would never feel like my dog's are beautiful.
[ 00:24:29.440 -->  00:24:31.840] [SPEAKER_02] He was also drawing the Apple logo at one point,
[ 00:24:31.840 -->  00:24:33.960] [SPEAKER_02] because he had a laptop in front of him.
[ 00:24:33.960 -->  00:24:34.800] [SPEAKER_02] Oh, my.
[ 00:24:34.800 -->  00:24:37.160] [SPEAKER_02] And I was telling him, he was like,
[ 00:24:37.160 -->  00:24:38.360] [SPEAKER_02] it doesn't look like that one.
[ 00:24:38.360 -->  00:24:40.000] [SPEAKER_02] I was like, yeah, no, but it's more interesting.
[ 00:24:40.000 -->  00:24:41.440] [SPEAKER_02] I've seen that one all over.
[ 00:24:41.440 -->  00:24:44.160] [SPEAKER_02] I see that one everywhere, all over the world.
[ 00:24:44.160 -->  00:24:47.240] [SPEAKER_02] But that one, that one's different, that one's unique.
[ 00:24:47.240 -->  00:24:49.320] [SPEAKER_02] And he was like, yeah, but it's ugly.
[ 00:24:49.320 -->  00:24:51.160] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah, I told him that he,
[ 00:24:51.180 -->  00:24:54.740] [SPEAKER_09] like the idea of drawing was for him to practice,
[ 00:24:54.740 -->  00:24:57.100] [SPEAKER_09] because drawing is difficult,
[ 00:24:57.100 -->  00:24:59.580] [SPEAKER_09] and you need to know your forms,
[ 00:24:59.580 -->  00:25:03.180] [SPEAKER_09] and because we did a lot of erasing,
[ 00:25:03.180 -->  00:25:06.660] [SPEAKER_09] and then you have to erase and redo it,
[ 00:25:06.660 -->  00:25:09.140] [SPEAKER_09] and it's okay, and then you can try again,
[ 00:25:09.140 -->  00:25:10.220] [SPEAKER_09] again, and again.
[ 00:25:11.140 -->  00:25:13.340] [SPEAKER_09] The more practice, the better you get.
[ 00:25:13.340 -->  00:25:14.620] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:25:14.620 -->  00:25:18.300] [SPEAKER_02] But also, sometimes ugly things are good art.
[ 00:25:18.300 -->  00:25:20.020] [SPEAKER_02] Are good art, yeah.
[ 00:25:20.020 -->  00:25:20.860] [SPEAKER_05] That's good.
[ 00:25:21.560 -->  00:25:23.200] [SPEAKER_05] Thousands of doughnuts for ugly.
[ 00:25:23.200 -->  00:25:28.200] [SPEAKER_05] You know, they are, but with abstract art,
[ 00:25:28.320 -->  00:25:29.920] [SPEAKER_05] sometimes at the beginning,
[ 00:25:29.920 -->  00:25:34.040] [SPEAKER_05] it's very relative, right, what we like or not.
[ 00:25:35.120 -->  00:25:35.960] [SPEAKER_07] There's a book.
[ 00:25:35.960 -->  00:25:36.960] [SPEAKER_07] I didn't get that.
[ 00:25:36.960 -->  00:25:38.040] [SPEAKER_07] Could you try again?
[ 00:25:38.040 -->  00:25:38.880] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah.
[ 00:25:38.880 -->  00:25:40.440] [SPEAKER_07] I'm not talking to you.
[ 00:25:40.440 -->  00:25:43.840] [SPEAKER_03] I think, I can't remember what it is in English.
[ 00:25:43.840 -->  00:25:46.240] [SPEAKER_03] Why do I want to say the dot?
[ 00:25:46.240 -->  00:25:47.080] [SPEAKER_03] Or something?
[ 00:25:47.080 -->  00:25:48.400] [SPEAKER_03] Peter Reynolds.
[ 00:25:48.400 -->  00:25:49.240] [SPEAKER_03] Peter Reynolds.
[ 00:25:49.240 -->  00:25:50.080] [SPEAKER_03] And ish.
[ 00:25:50.740 -->  00:25:52.220] [SPEAKER_03] Is it that or ish?
[ 00:25:52.220 -->  00:25:53.140] [SPEAKER_03] Both books, but ish.
[ 00:25:53.140 -->  00:25:54.860] [SPEAKER_03] Okay, okay.
[ 00:25:54.860 -->  00:25:58.740] [SPEAKER_03] I think it's ish in the main character
[ 00:25:58.740 -->  00:26:01.100] [SPEAKER_03] is making a drawing, and they crumble it up,
[ 00:26:01.100 -->  00:26:03.260] [SPEAKER_03] and throw it to the floor, and do it again,
[ 00:26:03.260 -->  00:26:04.780] [SPEAKER_03] throw it to the floor, and do it again,
[ 00:26:04.780 -->  00:26:05.620] [SPEAKER_03] throw it to the floor.
[ 00:26:05.620 -->  00:26:07.500] [SPEAKER_03] It's about perspirance and not giving up.
[ 00:26:07.500 -->  00:26:10.100] [SPEAKER_03] So maybe if you guys want to have her read that.
[ 00:26:10.100 -->  00:26:11.300] [None] Well, not you guys, but like.
[ 00:26:11.300 -->  00:26:12.140] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:26:12.140 -->  00:26:14.180] [None] If you want to read it.
[ 00:26:14.180 -->  00:26:15.300] [None] It's a reading tweet.
[ 00:26:15.300 -->  00:26:16.140] [None] The whole, like.
[ 00:26:16.140 -->  00:26:17.500] [SPEAKER_03] And the students, yeah.
[ 00:26:17.520 -->  00:26:20.480] [SPEAKER_07] And it's like, it's called ish because the kid is like,
[ 00:26:20.480 -->  00:26:24.040] [SPEAKER_07] well, it looks like a dog ish.
[ 00:26:24.040 -->  00:26:24.880] [SPEAKER_07] Oh, I like that.
[ 00:26:24.880 -->  00:26:26.200] [SPEAKER_03] And it looks like a ish.
[ 00:26:26.200 -->  00:26:27.920] [SPEAKER_03] They have it in Spanish, casi.
[ 00:26:27.920 -->  00:26:29.000] [SPEAKER_03] We read it in Spanish.
[ 00:26:29.000 -->  00:26:29.840] [SPEAKER_03] We read casi.
[ 00:26:29.840 -->  00:26:30.660] [SPEAKER_01] Oh my gosh.
[ 00:26:30.660 -->  00:26:31.500] [SPEAKER_03] Is it from the show?
[ 00:26:31.500 -->  00:26:32.340] [SPEAKER_03] The character name?
[ 00:26:32.340 -->  00:26:34.400] [SPEAKER_03] I don't know what the character's name was.
[ 00:26:34.400 -->  00:26:35.480] [SPEAKER_03] I can't remember.
[ 00:26:35.480 -->  00:26:36.320] [SPEAKER_03] Yeah.
[ 00:26:36.320 -->  00:26:37.160] [SPEAKER_02] Casi un perro.
[ 00:26:38.120 -->  00:26:40.120] [SPEAKER_02] If we want to use that for the.
[ 00:26:40.120 -->  00:26:43.320] [SPEAKER_05] But it is really getting into that with art.
[ 00:26:43.320 -->  00:26:45.760] [SPEAKER_05] You just, at the beginning, you just don't enjoy it
[ 00:26:45.780 -->  00:26:47.540] [SPEAKER_05] because you feel so bad at it.
[ 00:26:47.540 -->  00:26:50.040] [SPEAKER_05] And you're always like judging your own
[ 00:26:50.040 -->  00:26:52.580] [SPEAKER_05] versus somebody else that is much better.
[ 00:26:52.580 -->  00:26:55.540] [SPEAKER_05] But like my daughter started drawing and painting
[ 00:26:55.540 -->  00:26:56.940] [SPEAKER_05] when she, during the pandemic,
[ 00:26:56.940 -->  00:26:58.140] [SPEAKER_05] she had never done it before.
[ 00:26:58.140 -->  00:27:00.460] [SPEAKER_05] And yeah, in the beginning, she felt very uncomfortable.
[ 00:27:00.460 -->  00:27:02.340] [SPEAKER_05] But she ended up creating a portfolio
[ 00:27:02.340 -->  00:27:04.020] [SPEAKER_05] two years later for LaGuardia.
[ 00:27:04.020 -->  00:27:07.540] [SPEAKER_05] She got in to find arts because of her art.
[ 00:27:08.380 -->  00:27:09.820] [None] And she never felt very comfortable.
[ 00:27:09.820 -->  00:27:11.940] [SPEAKER_05] And she started spending hours.
[ 00:27:11.940 -->  00:27:13.060] [SPEAKER_01] And Peter Rangel.
[ 00:27:13.080 -->  00:27:17.680] [SPEAKER_05] So if we can get them to just enjoy giving that process.
[ 00:27:17.680 -->  00:27:19.440] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, I think that's a beautiful dog.
[ 00:27:19.440 -->  00:27:20.440] [SPEAKER_02] It's so unique.
[ 00:27:20.440 -->  00:27:22.440] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I think just like continuing to reinforce
[ 00:27:22.440 -->  00:27:24.880] [SPEAKER_02] the message of keep practicing.
[ 00:27:26.600 -->  00:27:29.880] [None] And also that message of ugly things aren't bad art.
[ 00:27:29.880 -->  00:27:30.920] [None] They're just different.
[ 00:27:30.920 -->  00:27:33.200] [None] And sometimes people like that more.
[ 00:27:34.880 -->  00:27:38.520] [None] It looks like an original Israel piece.
[ 00:27:38.520 -->  00:27:41.040] [SPEAKER_02] It's not like anything anyone else would draw.
[ 00:27:41.820 -->  00:27:44.180] [SPEAKER_02] And like seeing the value in that.
[ 00:27:44.180 -->  00:27:47.580] [SPEAKER_02] As long as we all have that same like messaging, I think.
[ 00:27:47.580 -->  00:27:49.100] [SPEAKER_02] Because they're not gonna just stop being like,
[ 00:27:49.100 -->  00:27:49.940] [SPEAKER_02] it's ugly.
[ 00:27:51.380 -->  00:27:53.780] [SPEAKER_02] That goes throughout high school.
[ 00:27:55.100 -->  00:27:56.820] [SPEAKER_06] But I feel like he needs,
[ 00:27:56.820 -->  00:28:01.820] [SPEAKER_06] I was just thinking last week when we were in meeting,
[ 00:28:01.940 -->  00:28:04.100] [SPEAKER_06] that he said something like,
[ 00:28:04.100 -->  00:28:07.680] [SPEAKER_06] para hacer esto se necesita mucha paciencia.
[ 00:28:07.680 -->  00:28:08.520] [SPEAKER_06] Me encanta.
[ 00:28:08.520 -->  00:28:11.920] [SPEAKER_06] And like, yo no tengo paciencia.
[ 00:28:11.920 -->  00:28:14.360] [SPEAKER_06] And then you keep talking to him,
[ 00:28:14.360 -->  00:28:16.320] [SPEAKER_06] then he's like, oh, okay.
[ 00:28:16.320 -->  00:28:19.160] [SPEAKER_06] And I was telling him, do you remember when we did,
[ 00:28:19.160 -->  00:28:21.200] [SPEAKER_06] with Manuel, like the process of something?
[ 00:28:21.200 -->  00:28:26.200] [SPEAKER_06] And I remember he drew a lime tree or something like that.
[ 00:28:27.800 -->  00:28:32.320] [SPEAKER_06] And I told him, you have like a lot of patience doing that.
[ 00:28:32.780 -->  00:28:33.620] [SPEAKER_06] And he was great.
[ 00:28:33.620 -->  00:28:35.740] [SPEAKER_06] And he was like, oh, yeah.
[ 00:28:35.740 -->  00:28:37.460] [SPEAKER_06] And then he was like, okay.
[ 00:28:37.460 -->  00:28:38.660] [SPEAKER_06] And then he kept knitting.
[ 00:28:38.660 -->  00:28:41.460] [SPEAKER_06] And after a little bit, he said like,
[ 00:28:41.460 -->  00:28:43.620] [SPEAKER_06] tengo que tener paciencia.
[ 00:28:43.620 -->  00:28:45.220] [SPEAKER_06] Me encanta.
[ 00:28:45.220 -->  00:28:46.060] [SPEAKER_01] It works.
[ 00:28:46.060 -->  00:28:49.340] [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, so I feel like he needs that push at the beginning.
[ 00:28:49.340 -->  00:28:50.620] [SPEAKER_06] And then.
[ 00:28:50.620 -->  00:28:52.140] [SPEAKER_05] Especially with these children,
[ 00:28:52.140 -->  00:28:54.260] [SPEAKER_05] I don't know why it just works so wonderfully
[ 00:28:54.260 -->  00:28:56.140] [SPEAKER_05] to remind them, well, this is learning.
[ 00:28:56.140 -->  00:28:57.340] [SPEAKER_05] This is important for us.
[ 00:28:57.340 -->  00:28:58.620] [SPEAKER_05] You want to be learning.
[ 00:28:58.620 -->  00:29:00.820] [SPEAKER_05] You want to ask for more opportunities to learn.
[ 00:29:00.840 -->  00:29:03.000] [SPEAKER_05] Or why are we, what is bilingual?
[ 00:29:03.000 -->  00:29:05.200] [SPEAKER_05] Being bilingual, you ask that question today.
[ 00:29:05.200 -->  00:29:07.640] [SPEAKER_05] It's an important question to remind them.
[ 00:29:07.640 -->  00:29:09.840] [SPEAKER_05] It's not that they don't know, but to remind them.
[ 00:29:09.840 -->  00:29:11.160] [SPEAKER_02] Did the connection make any sense?
[ 00:29:11.160 -->  00:29:12.360] [SPEAKER_02] The connection I was trying to make
[ 00:29:12.360 -->  00:29:15.000] [SPEAKER_02] between like different languages of storytelling
[ 00:29:15.000 -->  00:29:18.880] [SPEAKER_02] and being bilingual in general.
[ 00:29:18.880 -->  00:29:21.000] [SPEAKER_02] I don't know if that, I spent enough time on that.
[ 00:29:21.000 -->  00:29:23.280] [SPEAKER_02] But I was trying to connect.
[ 00:29:23.280 -->  00:29:25.240] [SPEAKER_05] Different ways of narrating.
[ 00:29:25.240 -->  00:29:26.080] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:29:27.360 -->  00:29:28.760] [SPEAKER_02] I might have used the wrong.
[ 00:29:29.740 -->  00:29:31.940] [SPEAKER_08] I feel like I got it.
[ 00:29:31.940 -->  00:29:32.780] [SPEAKER_08] Like as an adult.
[ 00:29:32.780 -->  00:29:35.860] [SPEAKER_08] But I don't know, maybe some kids probably did.
[ 00:29:35.860 -->  00:29:36.700] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah.
[ 00:29:36.700 -->  00:29:37.540] [SPEAKER_08] Some maybe not.
[ 00:29:37.540 -->  00:29:38.980] [SPEAKER_08] As long as it made sense.
[ 00:29:38.980 -->  00:29:39.820] [SPEAKER_07] No, it did.
[ 00:29:39.820 -->  00:29:41.660] [SPEAKER_05] It was that because they're bilingual,
[ 00:29:41.660 -->  00:29:44.180] [SPEAKER_05] they don't have two ways of narrating.
[ 00:29:44.180 -->  00:29:47.340] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I was thinking like storytelling in the way.
[ 00:29:47.340 -->  00:29:48.180] [SPEAKER_01] The phone.
[ 00:29:48.180 -->  00:29:49.000] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, the way that they gave.
[ 00:29:49.000 -->  00:29:49.840] [SPEAKER_01] Images of otakon.
[ 00:29:49.840 -->  00:29:51.260] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, different.
[ 00:29:51.260 -->  00:29:53.420] [SPEAKER_02] That's one language of storytelling.
[ 00:29:53.420 -->  00:29:55.820] [SPEAKER_02] Whereas animation is another language of storytelling.
[ 00:29:55.840 -->  00:29:59.040] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, you said there are multiple languages.
[ 00:29:59.040 -->  00:30:01.040] [SPEAKER_05] And we can get you this.
[ 00:30:01.040 -->  00:30:01.880] [SPEAKER_05] I don't know.
[ 00:30:01.880 -->  00:30:02.720] [SPEAKER_01] I don't know.
[ 00:30:02.720 -->  00:30:04.320] [SPEAKER_05] I didn't make the connection immediately.
[ 00:30:04.320 -->  00:30:06.360] [SPEAKER_05] But now that you're backing up.
[ 00:30:06.360 -->  00:30:07.840] [SPEAKER_02] Hopefully that'll happen.
[ 00:30:07.840 -->  00:30:09.800] [SPEAKER_02] I was focusing on what are the different things
[ 00:30:09.800 -->  00:30:11.120] [SPEAKER_05] I'm trying to write it down.
[ 00:30:11.120 -->  00:30:12.720] [SPEAKER_05] It's not that important.
[ 00:30:12.720 -->  00:30:16.360] [SPEAKER_05] So what's the learning that you saw in your group today?
[ 00:30:16.360 -->  00:30:20.720] [SPEAKER_02] I'd say the big part was Israel.
[ 00:30:21.800 -->  00:30:25.560] [SPEAKER_02] Seeing that growth in him of coming from like,
[ 00:30:26.260 -->  00:30:27.740] [SPEAKER_02] it's ugly and I give up to,
[ 00:30:27.740 -->  00:30:30.180] [SPEAKER_02] it's ugly but it's better than the last one.
[ 00:30:30.180 -->  00:30:31.020] [SPEAKER_02] He didn't say that,
[ 00:30:31.020 -->  00:30:34.220] [SPEAKER_02] but it seemed to be more of his attitude at the end.
[ 00:30:34.220 -->  00:30:39.220] [SPEAKER_02] And I think doing the,
[ 00:30:39.540 -->  00:30:40.980] [SPEAKER_02] they learned a lot of patience,
[ 00:30:40.980 -->  00:30:42.820] [SPEAKER_02] or at least became more patient
[ 00:30:42.820 -->  00:30:45.540] [SPEAKER_02] as they went along with on the floor there.
[ 00:30:45.540 -->  00:30:46.700] [SPEAKER_02] Because at first they were like,
[ 00:30:46.700 -->  00:30:48.300] [SPEAKER_02] okay, we want to move it over there.
[ 00:30:48.300 -->  00:30:49.740] [SPEAKER_02] And I'm like, no, if you do it fast,
[ 00:30:49.740 -->  00:30:52.140] [SPEAKER_02] it's not gonna, the animation isn't gonna work.
[ 00:30:52.140 -->  00:30:55.420] [SPEAKER_02] So I had to do a few photos for them.
[ 00:30:56.400 -->  00:30:58.640] [SPEAKER_05] I see because to move it to this side,
[ 00:30:58.640 -->  00:31:00.600] [SPEAKER_02] you have to take all these pictures.
[ 00:31:00.600 -->  00:31:01.880] [SPEAKER_02] Okay, it's there.
[ 00:31:01.880 -->  00:31:04.640] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but it's the, yeah, they understood.
[ 00:31:04.640 -->  00:31:07.800] [SPEAKER_05] The delaying the rework,
[ 00:31:07.800 -->  00:31:10.040] [SPEAKER_05] which is so important for academic learning.
[ 00:31:10.040 -->  00:31:10.880] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:31:10.880 -->  00:31:12.120] [SPEAKER_02] How's that?
[ 00:31:12.120 -->  00:31:14.760] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, and then they even understood at the end
[ 00:31:14.760 -->  00:31:18.960] [SPEAKER_02] that like, in order to make them get to the trash can fast,
[ 00:31:18.960 -->  00:31:22.920] [SPEAKER_02] they don't just jump over there, but they do go faster.
[ 00:31:22.920 -->  00:31:25.160] [SPEAKER_02] They're not like doing the same speed
[ 00:31:25.900 -->  00:31:27.580] [SPEAKER_05] they were doing the first time.
[ 00:31:27.580 -->  00:31:29.300] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, because they're sliding down?
[ 00:31:30.660 -->  00:31:33.300] [SPEAKER_02] Just like when they jumped up onto the slide,
[ 00:31:33.300 -->  00:31:34.820] [SPEAKER_02] or like different moments, they were like,
[ 00:31:34.820 -->  00:31:37.060] [SPEAKER_02] yeah, they're jumping, so they go faster.
[ 00:31:38.380 -->  00:31:39.220] [SPEAKER_05] And they had that idea.
[ 00:31:39.220 -->  00:31:41.260] [SPEAKER_02] They had logic to it, but yeah.
[ 00:31:44.300 -->  00:31:46.460] [SPEAKER_06] Maybe we can show them tomorrow,
[ 00:31:46.460 -->  00:31:48.900] [SPEAKER_06] that was the beginning, so they can see what.
[ 00:31:48.900 -->  00:31:49.740] [SPEAKER_05] We can show them.
[ 00:31:49.740 -->  00:31:52.020] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, what they did.
[ 00:31:52.020 -->  00:31:52.860] [SPEAKER_05] This is great.
[ 00:31:52.860 -->  00:31:54.220] [SPEAKER_05] This is two groups.
[ 00:31:54.240 -->  00:31:55.080] [SPEAKER_02] One group.
[ 00:31:55.080 -->  00:31:55.920] [SPEAKER_05] This is one group.
[ 00:31:55.920 -->  00:31:59.080] [SPEAKER_05] One group, one group, you have one group, yes.
[ 00:31:59.080 -->  00:32:02.800] [SPEAKER_05] Why did you not have human beings,
[ 00:32:02.800 -->  00:32:05.200] [SPEAKER_05] people that Israel wanted?
[ 00:32:05.200 -->  00:32:06.680] [SPEAKER_02] I didn't say that we couldn't.
[ 00:32:06.680 -->  00:32:11.680] [SPEAKER_02] I just said that we have an idea here of a dog and a cat.
[ 00:32:11.760 -->  00:32:13.360] [SPEAKER_02] Let's start with that, and like,
[ 00:32:13.360 -->  00:32:15.920] [SPEAKER_02] let's start to think about the story.
[ 00:32:15.920 -->  00:32:18.600] [SPEAKER_02] And I kept saying, like, I said several times,
[ 00:32:18.600 -->  00:32:20.520] [SPEAKER_02] like, we can't put a person in.
[ 00:32:20.520 -->  00:32:23.280] [SPEAKER_02] But you decided to have to just draw a dog if you had to.
[ 00:32:23.300 -->  00:32:27.780] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, he made the dog, so he got distracted by other things.
[ 00:32:27.780 -->  00:32:28.980] [SPEAKER_02] And then he made the trash can.
[ 00:32:28.980 -->  00:32:30.980] [SPEAKER_05] So you were accepting of the idea.
[ 00:32:30.980 -->  00:32:32.900] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I wasn't saying we can't have the person,
[ 00:32:32.900 -->  00:32:34.700] [SPEAKER_02] but other students were saying, like,
[ 00:32:34.700 -->  00:32:36.180] [SPEAKER_02] no, just the dog and a cat.
[ 00:32:36.180 -->  00:32:38.180] [SPEAKER_05] Or they felt that they didn't want to be a person.
[ 00:32:38.180 -->  00:32:40.300] [SPEAKER_02] Well, they wanted it to be either just a cat
[ 00:32:40.300 -->  00:32:41.140] [SPEAKER_02] or just a dog, and I was like,
[ 00:32:41.140 -->  00:32:43.900] [SPEAKER_02] it makes sense to have a story about a cat and a dog.
[ 00:32:43.900 -->  00:32:45.300] [SPEAKER_02] I don't know, I was just trying to get them
[ 00:32:45.300 -->  00:32:49.100] [SPEAKER_02] to get the ball rolling on storytelling.
[ 00:32:49.100 -->  00:32:51.420] [SPEAKER_05] No, I'm thinking about representation,
[ 00:32:51.440 -->  00:32:55.520] [SPEAKER_05] making sure that everybody's ideas are there
[ 00:32:55.520 -->  00:32:58.240] [SPEAKER_05] and recognized and valued equally, right?
[ 00:32:58.240 -->  00:32:59.920] [SPEAKER_05] So thinking about how that process was,
[ 00:32:59.920 -->  00:33:02.600] [SPEAKER_05] how they decided on the cat and the dog.
[ 00:33:02.600 -->  00:33:04.120] [SPEAKER_05] Because sometimes it's, you know,
[ 00:33:04.120 -->  00:33:05.520] [SPEAKER_05] I've had children that said,
[ 00:33:05.520 -->  00:33:08.480] [SPEAKER_05] I don't want to draw human beings.
[ 00:33:08.480 -->  00:33:09.960] [SPEAKER_05] I'm not good at drawing humans.
[ 00:33:09.960 -->  00:33:12.880] [SPEAKER_05] They want to draw, I don't know, a dog.
[ 00:33:12.880 -->  00:33:14.120] [SPEAKER_05] I don't know.
[ 00:33:14.120 -->  00:33:16.360] [SPEAKER_05] In this case, it doesn't seem it was connected.
[ 00:33:16.360 -->  00:33:19.040] [SPEAKER_02] No, yeah, I left it open.
[ 00:33:19.060 -->  00:33:24.060] [SPEAKER_02] We can add a human to the story, but I wanted an action.
[ 00:33:24.380 -->  00:33:27.340] [SPEAKER_05] Any other, in six minutes, any other learning?
[ 00:33:27.340 -->  00:33:30.620] [SPEAKER_05] Hannah, would you like to share your insights with us?
[ 00:33:30.620 -->  00:33:32.900] [SPEAKER_04] I know you were trying to grade, but.
[ 00:33:32.900 -->  00:33:33.740] [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, right.
[ 00:33:33.740 -->  00:33:36.780] [SPEAKER_04] Historically, the grades keep disappearing.
[ 00:33:36.780 -->  00:33:39.140] [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I have a couple of thoughts.
[ 00:33:39.140 -->  00:33:43.060] [SPEAKER_00] One about, I really, really like
[ 00:33:43.060 -->  00:33:48.060] [SPEAKER_00] these sort of longer term projects too for them
[ 00:33:48.080 -->  00:33:53.080] [SPEAKER_00] and maybe having some sort of gallery walk
[ 00:33:53.200 -->  00:33:57.680] [SPEAKER_00] or something at the end of the week where they can,
[ 00:33:57.680 -->  00:33:58.520] [SPEAKER_00] I don't know.
[ 00:33:58.520 -->  00:34:01.880] [SPEAKER_04] Which reminds me that we could do something like this.
[ 00:34:01.880 -->  00:34:03.000] [SPEAKER_04] Sorry for interrupting.
[ 00:34:03.000 -->  00:34:04.000] [SPEAKER_04] Yeah.
[ 00:34:04.000 -->  00:34:06.400] [SPEAKER_04] We have, have you seen this?
[ 00:34:06.400 -->  00:34:09.080] [SPEAKER_04] The In Queen Project Gallery for Students,
[ 00:34:09.080 -->  00:34:12.000] [SPEAKER_05] integrated project, and this is a system
[ 00:34:12.000 -->  00:34:14.160] [SPEAKER_05] that we could create with the little movies.
[ 00:34:14.160 -->  00:34:16.120] [SPEAKER_05] It says these are about bilingual children
[ 00:34:16.120 -->  00:34:17.120] [SPEAKER_05] and pre-service teachers,
[ 00:34:17.140 -->  00:34:19.940] [SPEAKER_05] and you can look at the different presentation.
[ 00:34:19.940 -->  00:34:22.860] [SPEAKER_05] And you can go into different virtual rooms.
[ 00:34:22.860 -->  00:34:26.060] [SPEAKER_05] Like, okay, I got, sorry, I'm in the wrong,
[ 00:34:26.060 -->  00:34:27.300] [SPEAKER_05] let me go up.
[ 00:34:27.300 -->  00:34:29.860] [SPEAKER_05] Here's a door, I go to another room,
[ 00:34:29.860 -->  00:34:32.220] [SPEAKER_05] and here are more designed about bilingual identity
[ 00:34:32.220 -->  00:34:34.340] [SPEAKER_05] development in language and literacy practices,
[ 00:34:34.340 -->  00:34:37.060] [SPEAKER_05] and I can move around, I can look at the presentation,
[ 00:34:37.060 -->  00:34:38.380] [SPEAKER_05] I can give them feedback.
[ 00:34:38.380 -->  00:34:40.060] [SPEAKER_02] That could be a fun thing to do on the board,
[ 00:34:40.060 -->  00:34:43.900] [SPEAKER_02] but I think if we have them do it all on their computers,
[ 00:34:43.900 -->  00:34:44.740] [SPEAKER_04] it might be chaotic.
[ 00:34:44.740 -->  00:34:45.700] [SPEAKER_04] I kind of suggested, but yes,
[ 00:34:45.720 -->  00:34:46.560] [SPEAKER_04] inviting the parents.
[ 00:34:46.560 -->  00:34:48.720] [SPEAKER_00] Also, like, a more, a more non-tangible.
[ 00:34:48.720 -->  00:34:51.080] [SPEAKER_00] So, like, just maybe having something, like,
[ 00:34:51.080 -->  00:34:53.080] [SPEAKER_00] at the end of every week, like,
[ 00:34:53.080 -->  00:34:56.560] [SPEAKER_00] just like five or 10 minutes at the end of the session
[ 00:34:56.560 -->  00:34:59.400] [SPEAKER_00] every week so they can celebrate their work
[ 00:34:59.400 -->  00:35:00.840] [SPEAKER_00] and see everything that they've done
[ 00:35:00.840 -->  00:35:02.840] [SPEAKER_00] over the course of the time,
[ 00:35:02.840 -->  00:35:05.480] [SPEAKER_00] especially if there's like a longer term project.
[ 00:35:06.640 -->  00:35:08.120] [SPEAKER_00] Because I feel like, yeah, they're at the age
[ 00:35:08.120 -->  00:35:10.240] [SPEAKER_00] where it's like, they're super, super proud
[ 00:35:10.240 -->  00:35:13.080] [SPEAKER_00] of something they work on over.
[ 00:35:13.080 -->  00:35:13.920] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:35:13.920 -->  00:35:15.160] [SPEAKER_05] And we haven't been doing that.
[ 00:35:15.660 -->  00:35:17.220] [SPEAKER_00] So, like, it's a longer time, like two weeks or whatever,
[ 00:35:17.220 -->  00:35:20.140] [SPEAKER_00] and they make a big product at the end.
[ 00:35:21.420 -->  00:35:25.660] [SPEAKER_00] And the other thing is similar to somebody
[ 00:35:25.660 -->  00:35:27.540] [SPEAKER_00] was adding on to it, like,
[ 00:35:27.540 -->  00:35:30.220] [SPEAKER_00] a way to share more with the families.
[ 00:35:30.220 -->  00:35:33.780] [SPEAKER_00] I don't know, like, making a drive or something
[ 00:35:33.780 -->  00:35:36.980] [SPEAKER_00] that they can check and see the work
[ 00:35:36.980 -->  00:35:38.620] [SPEAKER_00] that the students are doing, like,
[ 00:35:38.620 -->  00:35:43.620] [SPEAKER_00] uploading pictures and, like, sending things home a lot.
[ 00:35:43.640 -->  00:35:45.440] [SPEAKER_00] Like, I know you guys already have some days
[ 00:35:45.440 -->  00:35:47.720] [SPEAKER_00] where they can come in, but just, like,
[ 00:35:47.720 -->  00:35:51.840] [SPEAKER_00] having a place where they can also look
[ 00:35:51.840 -->  00:35:56.100] [SPEAKER_00] and check on what the kids are doing, I think,
[ 00:35:58.200 -->  00:35:59.560] [SPEAKER_00] like, when we do stuff like that,
[ 00:35:59.560 -->  00:36:01.840] [SPEAKER_00] the parents really appreciate it.
[ 00:36:01.840 -->  00:36:04.520] [SPEAKER_05] So they have access to, like, Google Drive?
[ 00:36:04.520 -->  00:36:08.000] [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, like, if you just send, like, a note or whatever
[ 00:36:08.000 -->  00:36:09.520] [SPEAKER_00] with a code or something.
[ 00:36:09.520 -->  00:36:12.160] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, we haven't been doing, in past years,
[ 00:36:12.160 -->  00:36:13.940] [SPEAKER_05] we have done that in other afterschools,
[ 00:36:13.940 -->  00:36:16.140] [SPEAKER_05] sending a flyer home once a month
[ 00:36:16.140 -->  00:36:19.460] [SPEAKER_05] or with photographs of the activities and the news.
[ 00:36:19.460 -->  00:36:20.660] [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, exactly.
[ 00:36:20.660 -->  00:36:23.500] [SPEAKER_00] Just some form of that, like, either a drive
[ 00:36:23.500 -->  00:36:27.700] [SPEAKER_00] or, like, a collage or something like that,
[ 00:36:27.700 -->  00:36:28.540] [SPEAKER_05] I think is really good.
[ 00:36:28.540 -->  00:36:30.500] [SPEAKER_05] And we have to think about bringing the parents
[ 00:36:30.500 -->  00:36:33.420] [SPEAKER_05] because it's been, they came once, really,
[ 00:36:33.420 -->  00:36:35.460] [SPEAKER_05] because then things got interrupted.
[ 00:36:35.460 -->  00:36:38.020] [SPEAKER_05] So, yeah, we think about that connection with the parents
[ 00:36:38.020 -->  00:36:39.180] [SPEAKER_05] and miss them, too.
[ 00:36:39.180 -->  00:36:41.300] [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, especially stuff like this is, like,
[ 00:36:41.320 -->  00:36:43.320] [SPEAKER_00] really nice and the kids will be so excited
[ 00:36:43.320 -->  00:36:44.900] [SPEAKER_00] to show their parents.
[ 00:36:46.000 -->  00:36:47.680] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah, this is what, I feel like, makes a lot of sense
[ 00:36:47.680 -->  00:36:50.160] [SPEAKER_07] to have this really be something that we can,
[ 00:36:50.160 -->  00:36:51.880] [SPEAKER_07] like, we provide them that.
[ 00:36:51.880 -->  00:36:53.200] [SPEAKER_05] Thank you for the reminder.
[ 00:36:53.200 -->  00:36:57.720] [SPEAKER_05] We're kind of forgetting half of where learning happens.
[ 00:36:57.720 -->  00:37:00.160] [SPEAKER_05] I know it's present, and it just hasn't happened
[ 00:37:00.160 -->  00:37:02.120] [SPEAKER_05] for different reasons, but we'll go back to it.
[ 00:37:02.120 -->  00:37:02.960] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:37:05.760 -->  00:37:10.760] [SPEAKER_05] Any other insights, or are we adding music, sound,
[ 00:37:11.320 -->  00:37:13.920] [SPEAKER_05] are we writing about this, what do you think?
[ 00:37:13.920 -->  00:37:16.760] [SPEAKER_05] Can we take use out of this more?
[ 00:37:16.760 -->  00:37:19.080] [SPEAKER_02] We can do a music session, yeah,
[ 00:37:19.080 -->  00:37:22.280] [SPEAKER_02] with some sort of music workshop next to AXTA.
[ 00:37:22.280 -->  00:37:24.840] [SPEAKER_09] Oh, yeah, Dylan asked me if they can add music
[ 00:37:24.840 -->  00:37:25.680] [SPEAKER_09] to their video.
[ 00:37:25.680 -->  00:37:27.160] [SPEAKER_09] Awesome, yeah, I'm in.
[ 00:37:27.160 -->  00:37:28.000] [SPEAKER_09] Because he wanted to add.
[ 00:37:28.000 -->  00:37:29.560] [SPEAKER_09] I didn't get that last time, but yeah.
[ 00:37:29.560 -->  00:37:31.800] [SPEAKER_09] He wanted to add, I believe.
[ 00:37:31.800 -->  00:37:32.640] [SPEAKER_09] Mm.
[ 00:37:32.640 -->  00:37:33.880] [SPEAKER_09] Okay.
[ 00:37:33.880 -->  00:37:34.720] [SPEAKER_03] And words?
[ 00:37:36.840 -->  00:37:40.120] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, is Christina Stone after?
[ 00:37:40.120 -->  00:37:40.960] [SPEAKER_05] We can talk.
[ 00:37:41.900 -->  00:37:44.140] [SPEAKER_07] I don't know if you have any ideas
[ 00:37:44.140 -->  00:37:46.340] [SPEAKER_07] about what that might look like, or how we might do that,
[ 00:37:46.340 -->  00:37:47.500] [SPEAKER_07] but we can talk about it.
[ 00:37:47.500 -->  00:37:48.980] [SPEAKER_02] You haven't done that.
[ 00:37:48.980 -->  00:37:51.580] [SPEAKER_02] I mean, it could be as simple as, like,
[ 00:37:51.580 -->  00:37:53.820] [SPEAKER_02] pick a song that you know, and then I could go
[ 00:37:53.820 -->  00:37:56.740] [SPEAKER_02] and put it underneath the video.
[ 00:37:56.740 -->  00:37:58.420] [SPEAKER_00] Or, like, if Donna writes something,
[ 00:37:58.420 -->  00:38:00.620] [SPEAKER_00] it could be like two characters in a conversation,
[ 00:38:00.620 -->  00:38:02.060] [SPEAKER_00] they kind of like speech bubbles,
[ 00:38:02.060 -->  00:38:03.700] [SPEAKER_00] and just put the speech bubble for a few pictures,
[ 00:38:03.700 -->  00:38:05.020] [SPEAKER_02] and take it away and change it.
[ 00:38:05.020 -->  00:38:05.900] [SPEAKER_02] Physically.
[ 00:38:05.900 -->  00:38:07.780] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, and if it's something like that, yeah.
[ 00:38:07.780 -->  00:38:09.420] [SPEAKER_02] Do a speech bubble and write it.
[ 00:38:11.780 -->  00:38:13.780] [SPEAKER_08] Or they could record it.
[ 00:38:16.340 -->  00:38:18.340] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, we could also record audio for it.
[ 00:38:18.340 -->  00:38:20.860] [SPEAKER_05] They could record audio, and also have the speech bubbles.
[ 00:38:20.860 -->  00:38:22.700] [SPEAKER_05] We have the oral language, the written language,
[ 00:38:22.700 -->  00:38:23.780] [SPEAKER_07] the visual.
[ 00:38:23.780 -->  00:38:27.340] [SPEAKER_07] Most of them are also like programs on computers that you can.
[ 00:38:27.340 -->  00:38:28.180] [SPEAKER_02] For music making.
[ 00:38:28.180 -->  00:38:30.180] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah, like simple.
[ 00:38:30.180 -->  00:38:31.580] [SPEAKER_02] There are, yeah.
[ 00:38:31.580 -->  00:38:32.780] [SPEAKER_07] I don't know a lot about it.
[ 00:38:32.780 -->  00:38:33.980] [SPEAKER_07] We can look into it.
[ 00:38:33.980 -->  00:38:37.380] [SPEAKER_05] I mean, a PowerPoint would allow you to record audio.
[ 00:38:37.380 -->  00:38:39.060] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but there are some, like,
[ 00:38:39.080 -->  00:38:41.680] [SPEAKER_02] some tools that you can use to make simple beats.
[ 00:38:41.680 -->  00:38:42.520] [SPEAKER_02] And like, you know.
[ 00:38:42.520 -->  00:38:43.360] [SPEAKER_02] A little melody.
[ 00:38:43.360 -->  00:38:45.440] [SPEAKER_07] Yeah, almost like a mini,
[ 00:38:45.440 -->  00:38:47.480] [SPEAKER_07] there's like different programs on computers.
[ 00:38:47.480 -->  00:38:49.600] [SPEAKER_08] Yeah, I mean, if it's short, there are lots of free ones,
[ 00:38:49.600 -->  00:38:52.320] [SPEAKER_08] but then if they're longer, then they have the.
[ 00:38:52.320 -->  00:38:53.160] [SPEAKER_08] The paywall.
[ 00:38:53.160 -->  00:38:53.980] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:38:53.980 -->  00:38:54.960] [None] Well, these are five seconds long.
[ 00:38:54.960 -->  00:38:55.800] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:38:55.800 -->  00:38:56.640] [None] Yeah.
[ 00:38:56.640 -->  00:38:58.920] [SPEAKER_05] But there's a lot of beauty in that.
[ 00:38:58.920 -->  00:39:01.160] [SPEAKER_05] And there's a sequence, and you know,
[ 00:39:01.160 -->  00:39:05.080] [SPEAKER_05] it's just another, it's another text, it's a visual text.
[ 00:39:05.080 -->  00:39:08.360] [SPEAKER_05] So, you keep saying, you know, it's only five seconds,
[ 00:39:08.380 -->  00:39:10.420] [SPEAKER_05] but we are very impressed, right?
[ 00:39:10.420 -->  00:39:11.260] [SPEAKER_05] Oh, yeah.
[ 00:39:11.260 -->  00:39:12.080] [SPEAKER_05] I know, I mean.
[ 00:39:12.080 -->  00:39:12.920] [SPEAKER_05] It's a super movie.
[ 00:39:12.920 -->  00:39:13.760] [SPEAKER_05] You're gonna be so.
[ 00:39:13.760 -->  00:39:15.620] [SPEAKER_06] There's a lot in just the five seconds.
[ 00:39:15.620 -->  00:39:17.220] [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, there you go.
[ 00:39:17.220 -->  00:39:19.100] [SPEAKER_05] And because, you know, it's just the beginning.
[ 00:39:19.100 -->  00:39:21.540] [SPEAKER_05] I think that the children will generate new ideas
[ 00:39:21.540 -->  00:39:22.580] [SPEAKER_05] from this work.
[ 00:39:23.780 -->  00:39:24.720] [SPEAKER_05] Seeing these ones.
[ 00:39:26.420 -->  00:39:27.620] [SPEAKER_02] This was fun.
[ 00:39:27.620 -->  00:39:28.460] [SPEAKER_02] It was fun.
[ 00:39:28.460 -->  00:39:29.280] [SPEAKER_02] It was a lot.
[ 00:39:29.280 -->  00:39:30.120] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah.
[ 00:39:30.120 -->  00:39:33.460] [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, the last time I ran this, it was like a workshop
[ 00:39:33.460 -->  00:39:35.380] [SPEAKER_02] on like a Steam event day,
[ 00:39:35.400 -->  00:39:39.120] [SPEAKER_02] and I had different groups of like five fourth
[ 00:39:39.120 -->  00:39:41.240] [SPEAKER_02] and fifth graders coming every 15 minutes.
[ 00:39:41.240 -->  00:39:44.280] [SPEAKER_02] So like, I would finish with one, another would come.
[ 00:39:44.280 -->  00:39:46.880] [SPEAKER_02] So running one today and one tomorrow feels
[ 00:39:46.880 -->  00:39:49.320] [SPEAKER_02] a lot more manageable for me, personally,
[ 00:39:49.320 -->  00:39:51.720] [None] but it did go, we went over time.
[ 00:39:51.720 -->  00:39:52.560] [None] It's okay, though.
[ 00:39:52.560 -->  00:39:53.400] [SPEAKER_06] Don't worry about it.
[ 00:39:53.400 -->  00:39:54.220] [SPEAKER_06] Probably some more.
[ 00:39:54.220 -->  00:39:55.680] [SPEAKER_02] You have to think about getting into this.
[ 00:39:55.680 -->  00:39:57.760] [SPEAKER_08] We were thinking, Christine and I were thinking
[ 00:39:57.760 -->  00:39:58.600] [SPEAKER_09] it might be okay.
[ 00:39:58.600 -->  00:39:59.440] [SPEAKER_05] It might get there.
[ 00:39:59.440 -->  00:40:03.100] [SPEAKER_09] That's what we were thinking when it was ready.
[ 00:40:03.320 -->  00:40:04.160] [SPEAKER_05] Um.
[ 00:40:05.280 -->  00:40:07.800] [SPEAKER_05] We're sorry that we ran out of time.
[ 00:40:07.800 -->  00:40:09.760] [SPEAKER_05] The others didn't share about the learning
[ 00:40:09.760 -->  00:40:10.680] [SPEAKER_05] and their teaching.
[ 00:40:10.680 -->  00:40:13.080] [SPEAKER_05] In our group, there was a lot of interesting.
[ 00:40:13.080 -->  00:40:13.920] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:40:13.920 -->  00:40:16.120] [SPEAKER_05] Do you think we could type what we've heard today?
[ 00:40:17.360 -->  00:40:18.200] [SPEAKER_07] We can.
[ 00:40:18.200 -->  00:40:22.300] [SPEAKER_07] I mean, I feel like, I hand wrote notes on the pages.
[ 00:40:24.320 -->  00:40:27.960] [SPEAKER_05] In a Word document, eventually having all their responses
[ 00:40:27.960 -->  00:40:30.760] [SPEAKER_05] or comments about reading.
[ 00:40:30.760 -->  00:40:31.660] [SPEAKER_07] We can.
[ 00:40:31.660 -->  00:40:32.500] [SPEAKER_07] Whatever you think.
[ 00:40:32.520 -->  00:40:33.360] [SPEAKER_07] I mean.
[ 00:40:35.240 -->  00:40:36.840] [SPEAKER_07] Whatever you think.
[ 00:40:36.840 -->  00:40:40.800] [SPEAKER_04] I mean, mine are horribly, I mean, I wrote very fast.
[ 00:40:40.800 -->  00:40:41.640] [SPEAKER_04] Yeah.
[ 00:40:41.640 -->  00:40:43.720] [SPEAKER_04] The kids were like, oh my gosh, you write so fast.
[ 00:40:43.720 -->  00:40:45.480] [SPEAKER_04] I'm like, what did you speak a lot?
[ 00:40:46.600 -->  00:40:49.880] [SPEAKER_07] I don't have as much, there's not as much.
[ 00:40:49.880 -->  00:40:52.200] [SPEAKER_07] I was going through it a bit quicker than you were,
[ 00:40:52.200 -->  00:40:55.920] [SPEAKER_07] so there's not as much comments to write about.
[ 00:40:55.920 -->  00:40:58.320] [SPEAKER_07] But I'm happy to type up what I did.
[ 00:40:58.320 -->  00:40:59.160] [SPEAKER_05] We organized it.
[ 00:40:59.160 -->  00:41:01.080] [SPEAKER_05] Even Kevin can help us organize it.
[ 00:41:01.080 -->  00:41:01.920] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:41:02.140 -->  00:41:02.980] [SPEAKER_05] Our handwriting.
[ 00:41:02.980 -->  00:41:03.800] [SPEAKER_05] Yeah.
[ 00:41:03.800 -->  00:41:05.660] [SPEAKER_05] But there was a lot of learning on our part.
[ 00:41:05.660 -->  00:41:06.500] [SPEAKER_05] Yes, for sure.
[ 00:41:06.500 -->  00:41:08.220] [SPEAKER_05] About their feelings about the stories
[ 00:41:08.220 -->  00:41:09.580] [SPEAKER_05] and reading and writing.
[ 00:41:09.580 -->  00:41:10.860] [SPEAKER_05] And I'm sure in the other team,
[ 00:41:10.860 -->  00:41:12.700] [SPEAKER_05] just write it in your learning notes,
[ 00:41:12.700 -->  00:41:14.620] [SPEAKER_05] and we'll talk more on Friday.
[ 00:41:14.620 -->  00:41:16.500] [SPEAKER_05] And thank you, Agustina, welcome to the group.
[ 00:41:16.500 -->  00:41:17.340] [SPEAKER_02] Yes, welcome.
[ 00:41:17.340 -->  00:41:20.900] [SPEAKER_05] Agustina's in my class, and she wants to learn
[ 00:41:20.900 -->  00:41:22.540] [SPEAKER_05] about the facts of knowledge of the children
[ 00:41:22.540 -->  00:41:24.500] [SPEAKER_05] for her curriculum project.
[ 00:41:24.500 -->  00:41:26.980] [SPEAKER_05] So she might visit us one day,
[ 00:41:26.980 -->  00:41:30.260] [SPEAKER_05] and maybe lead one of the groups to explore
[ 00:41:30.280 -->  00:41:32.680] [SPEAKER_05] the knowledge in whatever topic she wants herself
[ 00:41:32.680 -->  00:41:34.080] [SPEAKER_05] to use for her teaching.
[ 00:41:34.080 -->  00:41:34.920] [SPEAKER_09] Yeah.
[ 00:41:34.920 -->  00:41:36.880] [SPEAKER_05] So we welcome you in this space.
[ 00:41:36.880 -->  00:41:37.720] [None] Thank you.
[ 00:41:37.720 -->  00:41:38.540] [None] Thank you, chair.
[ 00:41:38.540 -->  00:41:39.380] [None] Thank you.
