0:00:00,0:00:03,SPEAKER_00,Scratch from the record.
0:00:03,0:00:06,SPEAKER_00,I'm going to sleep tonight.
0:00:06,0:00:08,SPEAKER_01,"Oh no, you're not celebrating?"
0:00:08,0:00:10,SPEAKER_01,"Well, we're going to have Chick-fil-A for dinner."
0:00:10,0:00:12,SPEAKER_01,That's going to be the celebration.
0:00:12,0:00:14,SPEAKER_01,"What do you have, chicken?"
0:00:14,0:00:16,SPEAKER_01,"I'm going to have Chick-fil-A for dinner, yeah."
0:00:16,0:00:19,SPEAKER_01,I'm going to pick it up on my way to Carmen's class.
0:00:19,0:00:21,SPEAKER_01,Busy day.
0:00:21,0:00:22,SPEAKER_01,Busy day.
0:00:22,0:00:23,SPEAKER_01,"This weekend, right?"
0:00:23,0:00:24,SPEAKER_01,Yeah.
0:00:24,0:00:26,SPEAKER_01,Are you celebrating Friday?
0:00:26,0:00:28,SPEAKER_01,When we meet for our 20th.
0:00:29,0:00:32,SPEAKER_01,"I don't know, with the coffee."
0:00:32,0:00:34,SPEAKER_01,I can't eat it.
0:00:36,0:00:38,SPEAKER_01,Alright.
0:00:38,0:00:40,SPEAKER_01,Here we are.
0:00:40,0:00:44,SPEAKER_01,"We met on Friday, the two candidates and us."
0:00:44,0:00:47,SPEAKER_01,We were thinking a lot about the program.
0:00:47,0:00:49,SPEAKER_01,So we tried new things today.
0:00:49,0:00:52,SPEAKER_01,We tried the stations.
0:00:52,0:00:55,SPEAKER_01,"What did you think about the stations, Bel√©n?"
0:00:55,0:00:57,SPEAKER_01,And the session?
0:00:57,0:01:02,SPEAKER_00,"I think overall, I would say thumbs up."
0:01:02,0:01:06,SPEAKER_00,I was ready for disaster.
0:01:06,0:01:11,SPEAKER_00,"Like, not enough kids, nobody engaging in any of the activities."
0:01:11,0:01:14,SPEAKER_00,Whatever can happen.
0:01:14,0:01:17,SPEAKER_00,"So for me, everything was positive."
0:01:17,0:01:26,SPEAKER_00,I heard some kids giving me suggestions on possible future stations.
0:01:26,0:01:33,SPEAKER_00,So they were very excited about having these small times to work on something.
0:01:33,0:01:35,SPEAKER_00,"Like, very focused."
0:01:35,0:01:39,SPEAKER_00,I worked with Joey in the reading.
0:01:39,0:01:44,SPEAKER_00,I was worried that that would be the boring station.
0:01:44,0:01:47,SPEAKER_00,"But actually, it turned out to be very good."
0:01:47,0:01:50,SPEAKER_00,I feel like we had the time to do repeated reading.
0:01:50,0:01:53,SPEAKER_00,We worked on difficult words.
0:01:54,0:01:58,SPEAKER_00,We didn't do a lot of out loud reading.
0:01:58,0:02:00,SPEAKER_00,Because they were not feeling confident.
0:02:00,0:02:05,SPEAKER_00,But at least I read a couple of times with one of them.
0:02:05,0:02:09,SPEAKER_00,They were asking about what is the meaning of this word.
0:02:09,0:02:11,SPEAKER_00,Or how do you pronounce this.
0:02:11,0:02:13,SPEAKER_00,Especially long words.
0:02:13,0:02:19,SPEAKER_00,And thank you everyone for committing to your stations.
0:02:20,0:02:24,SPEAKER_00,I know that I divided my responsibility in all of you.
0:02:24,0:02:27,SPEAKER_00,"So thank you, everybody."
0:02:27,0:02:30,SPEAKER_00,I hope that it worked.
