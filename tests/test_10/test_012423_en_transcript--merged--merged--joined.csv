0:00:06,0:00:57,SPEAKER_01,"Oh no, you're not celebrating? Well, we're going to have Chick-fil-A for dinner. That's going to be the celebration. What do you have, chicken? I'm going to have Chick-fil-A for dinner, yeah. I'm going to pick it up on my way to Carmen's class. Busy day. Busy day. This weekend, right? Yeah. Are you celebrating Friday? When we meet for our 20th. I don't know, with the coffee. I can't eat it. Alright. Here we are. We met on Friday, the two candidates and us. We were thinking a lot about the program. So we tried new things today. We tried the stations. What did you think about the stations, Bel√©n? And the session?"
0:00:57,0:02:30,SPEAKER_00,"I think overall, I would say thumbs up. I was ready for disaster. Like, not enough kids, nobody engaging in any of the activities. Whatever can happen. So for me, everything was positive. I heard some kids giving me suggestions on possible future stations. So they were very excited about having these small times to work on something. Like, very focused. I worked with Joey in the reading. I was worried that that would be the boring station. But actually, it turned out to be very good. I feel like we had the time to do repeated reading. We worked on difficult words. We didn't do a lot of out loud reading. Because they were not feeling confident. But at least I read a couple of times with one of them. They were asking about what is the meaning of this word. Or how do you pronounce this. Especially long words. And thank you everyone for committing to your stations. I know that I divided my responsibility in all of you. So thank you, everybody. I hope that it worked."
